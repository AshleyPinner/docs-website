All New Relic Partner API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Otherwise, Partner API calls will be rejected.

## Use Partner API v2

The New Relic Partner API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). This API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. The API uses the [JSON](http://www.json.org/ "Link opens in a new window") response format.

<Callout variant="important">
  This information is for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2.
</Callout>

## Find your Partner API key

The Partner API requires that you authenticate with the [REST API key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#rest-api) that is specific to your [partnership owner account](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions#partner-owner) (you cannot use the other [REST API keys](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key)).

When using your Partner API key with calls to [REST API (v2)](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2) endpoints that require the use of an **Admin user's API key**, see [Admin user's API Key and partnerships](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/admins-api-key-partnerships).

## Find your Partner ID

The Partner API also requires that you authenticate by providing a Partner ID specific to your partnership. This is unique from the [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) for your partnership owner account.

To obtain your Partner ID, go to your [partner admin console](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/getting-started/partnership-admin-console) and retrieve the partner ID number that is listed in your URL:

```
https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/â€‹$ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/partnerships/$PARTNER_ID
```

You must include the Partner ID as part of the base URL for the Partner API.

## Authenticate the API call

To authenticate to the Partner API when making an API call:

1. Add a request header labeled **x-api-key** and set its value to your **Partner API key**.
2. Include your **Partner ID** at the specified point in the request URI.

## Errors

New Relic uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success and codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (for example, a required parameter was missing).

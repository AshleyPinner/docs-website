Here are New Relic's resources for partners. If you are not a New Relic partner, follow standard procedures to [find help or file a support ticket](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/find-help-or-file-support-ticket).

## Integration assistance

For technical assistance or coordination to create your integration, contact your New Relic account representative. In addition, if you are interested in becoming a new partner, contact your New Relic account representative.

## Technical assistance (regular priority)

Once your integration is live, follow standard procedures to [find help or file a support ticket](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/find-help-or-file-support-ticket).

## Emergency technical assistance

The New Relic partner support queue is continually monitored during business hours (Pacific time). New Relic strives to respond to partner support requests sent by email within an hour. For emergency assistance, email **support @ newrelic.com**, or contact your New Relic account representative.

## Customer support

When your integration with New Relic is implemented and ready to launch, New Relic will arrange an introduction to your [technical support contacts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-integration-guide/support) at New Relic.

You can include or exclude the partnership name with your customer welcome messages.

These settings are controlled by New Relic. If you want to use this feature, please coordinate with the technical contact for your New Relic partnership.

## Multiple sub-partnerships

If your partnership does business under multiple names or in multiple different marketplaces using different branding, you can distinctively brand the different partnerships. This functionality is available using multiple sub-partnerships under a single partnership owner account. The partnerships can be distinct with several settings, including:

* Name
* Product pricing
* Branding (headers, footers, etc.)
* Billing configuration

After you log into your partnership owner account, you can select from the list of sub-partnership accounts.

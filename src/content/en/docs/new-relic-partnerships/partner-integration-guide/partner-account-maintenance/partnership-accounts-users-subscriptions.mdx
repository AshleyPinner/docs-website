Organizations with New Relic **partnership accounts** have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their master accounts and sub-accounts. This describes basic concepts and features available with a New Relic partnership.

## Partnerships with New Relic

There are two types of partnerships:

* A **partnership**: A service provider who partners with New Relic in offering New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of a New Relic partner.
* A **customer partnership**: a New Relic customer with a large, complex account hierarchy that uses New Relic's partnership account structure. (New Relic contacts customers whose account structures would benefit from such a change.)

Partnerships are identified by a numeric [`PARTNER_ID`](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partner-api-reference). In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another.

* Partnerships are administered by a [partnership owner account](#partner-owner). The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular [account](#accounts).
* If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique `PARTNER_ID`.

## Account hierarchy

New Relic partnership organizations consist of the [partnership owning account](#partner-owner), partnerships, master accounts, and sub-accounts. A partnership can have multiple master accounts and sub-accounts.

To understand how sub-accounts and master accounts scale with EU region accounts, see [EU region account hierarchy](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center#global-account-hierarchy).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you do not have a partnership organization, you can only have one master account. For more information, see [Manage apps or users with sub-accounts.](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts)
</Callout>

All master accounts and sub-accounts roll up to your partnership account.

## Partnership owner accounts (POA)

The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the [partner API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api), and manage other aspects of the partnership.

**Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account.** Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account.

* Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges.
* Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users.
* The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc.

The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the [New Relic Partnership API](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api) to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Many of the Partnership API calls return an [account status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object#account-status-definitions) as part of the XML.
</Callout>

## Sub-accounts with partnerships

[Sub-accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts) behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Sub-accounts**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Account creation
      </td>

      <td>
        * Sub-accounts can be created through the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-sub-account-object) or [New Relic user interface](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts).
        * In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have [Admin privileges](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/getting-started/partnership-admin-console), and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative.
        * Sub-accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the master account's subscription.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Billing
      </td>

      <td>
        * Billing is applied at the master account level.
        * **Exception:** Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Permissions
      </td>

      <td>
        * Admin-level users on a master account have the ability to create, modify, and delete sub-accounts for the master account.
        * Users that have been granted access permissions on a master account automatically inherit the same level of access for all sub-accounts. This is also true for [add-on roles](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-roles-permissions).
        * **Exception:** Sub-account users will not receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Account users

You can use the [Partnership user API](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object) to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the [Owner](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/users-roles#owner)) associated with it.

For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the [Users page in the New Relic UI](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/change-account-owner).

In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic.

## Partnership pricing

Accounts within a partnership organization may have different [levels of access](https://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing) to New Relic products.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Many of the Partnership API calls return a [subscription status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object#subscription-state) as part of the XML.
</Callout>

For accounts set up through a partnership:

* An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription.
* Promotions may appear as a subscription change.
* Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles [pricing and billing](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/new-relic-products-features/partner-products-pricing-billing).

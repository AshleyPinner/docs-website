New Relic offers a web service-based API through which partners can create, edit, upgrade, downgrade, and cancel New Relic accounts on behalf of their customers.

## API functions

The following functions are supported:

**Account:**

* Create new
* Show
* Update
* Cancel
* Set primary admin
* Show usage

**User:**

* Add user access to account
* Remove user access from account

**Subscription:** Change subscription terms

## Initial API call

The initial API call for all account-level interactions is to "create account." This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the `account_id`. All of the other calls in the Partner API require the `account_id` as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the `account_id`, and associate it with the users' partner account record.

## Password complexity and the API

Starting with v2 of the Partner API, passwords passed as part of an account creation call will be required to meet the following complexity minimums:

* 8 to 50 characters in length
* Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters
* Cannot contain spaces
* Must contain at least 1 letter
* Must contain at least 1 number or special character

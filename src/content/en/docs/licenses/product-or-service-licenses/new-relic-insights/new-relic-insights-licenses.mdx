We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Insights. Thank you, open-source community, for making these fine tools! Some of these are listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Product**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Licenses**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

Some New Relic functions require use of your account ID. Your account ID is the ID number we assign to your New Relic account. Note that some New Relic organizations will have multiple accounts with a master/sub-account structure.

Options for finding an account ID:

* If you have a single account: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) and then select **Account settings**. Next, select **API keys** located on the left-hand side. The account ID is displayed on the API keys page.
* If your organization has multiple accounts: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), select **Entity explorer** and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page.

For more on how account access works, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/cross-account-features-security-new-relic-one).

Options for downgrading your New Relic account:

* Pro or Enterprise accounts: contact your New Relic account representative.
* Standard account: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Manage your account**, and then select **Downgrade account**. Once the account is downgraded, you’ll still be able to access the account on the login page.
* Free account: If you have a free account, you don’t need to downgrade your account.

For more on adjusting data ingest, see [Data management](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data).

If you want to stop reporting data to New Relic, you must uninstall and/or delete all agents or other data-reporting integrations. For details, see the documentation for the relevant agents or integrations.

After [installing your containerized private minion (CPM)](/docs/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways:

* Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the [CPM status endpoint](#cpm-status).
* See if a private location is under-provisioned and [needs more minions](#more-minions).
* Review your [Docker logs](#) or [Kubernetes logs](#).

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also get notified of monitor failures with [New Relic's alerts](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/alerting-synthetics).
</Callout>

## Check CPM status using HTTP

Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: `8080` and `8180`. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints:

* `:8080/status/check`: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. `HTTP 200` means the status is healthy.
* `:8080/status`: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as `SyntheticsPrivateMinion` event.
* `:8180/`: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state.

## Check if your private location requires more minions

If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks.

To learn how to verify this, see [Does my private location need more minions?](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/monitor-private-locations#more-minions)

## Review logs

You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs.

    This is an example of a CPM log indicating that the minion is working properly in a Docker container system environment:

    This is an example of a CPM log indicating that the minion is working properly in a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment:

    First, get the name of the CPM pod you want to review logs for:

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
    ```

    Then, interact with that CPM pod:

    ```
    $ kubectl logs -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_NAME
    2020-05-11 22:57:24,084 - Minion will use 2 heavy workers
    2020-05-11 22:57:24,149 - Minion will use 50 lightweight workers
    2020-05-11 22:57:27,973 - Minion Container System: KUBERNETES
    2020-05-11 22:57:30,158 - Minion deployment mode: PRIVATE_MINION_POD_KUBERNETES
    2020-05-11 22:57:30,178 - No volume mounted at '/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics' in ':rw' mode: Private Minion's ID will change with each boot

## Enable debug logs

If you experience issues with your CPM, you can enable debug logs to help troubleshoot issues.

The default level of logging is set to only inform the user of key information and actionable errors. If this is insufficient, you can enable a more verbose logging by using the `MINION_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

      Adding `-f` to the `Docker logs` makes the command follow logs.
    </Callout>

    ```
    docker run ... -e MINION_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ...
      docker logs -f YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME
      ... verbose logging continues ...
    ```
  </Collapser>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Adding `-f` to the `Kubernetes logs` makes the command follow logs.
    </Callout>

    To enable DEBUG logs add the `--set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG` option when running your `helm install`:

    ```
    helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY --set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG
    ```

    Get the name of the CPM pod you want to review logs for:

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
    ```

    Then, interact with that CPM pod:

    ```
    kubectl logs -f -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME

    ... verbose logging continues ...
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Retrieve Kubernetes debugging information

If you experience issues with your CPM in a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, you can retrieve information about the CPM pod and the node it is running on to help troubleshoot.

To retrieve information for the CPM pod:

```
kubectl describe pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME
```

To retrieve information for the node the CPM pod is running on, identify the node, and then:

```
kubectl describe node NODE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME
```

## Monitor CPMs with New Relic Infrastructure

[New Relic's infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure) supports [advanced Docker monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/docker-instrumentation-infrastructure) and [advanced Kubernetes monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration). To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with `synthetics-minion-`. You can use these labels to identify CPM-spawned containers that are running your monitors. Example labels include:

* `synthetics-minion-runner-role`
* `synthetics-minion-runner-version`
* `synthetics-minion-container-id`
* `synthetics-minion-id`
* `synthetics-minion-build-number`
* `synthetics-minion-job`
* `synthetics-minion-account`
* `synthetics-minion-monitor`
* `synthetics-minion-monitor-version`
* `synthetics-minion-monitor-type`
* `synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label`

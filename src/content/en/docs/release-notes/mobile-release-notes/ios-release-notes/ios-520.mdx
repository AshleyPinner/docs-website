* The SDK now tracks the number and duration of network requests per interaction, which will be used in upcoming features.
* A session duration is now recorded for sessions that crash. Mobile crash events in Insights will have a session duration.

### Fixes

* Improves the accuracy of recording measurements in the SDK.

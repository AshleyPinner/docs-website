### Notes

**Improvements**

* Supports C++ linkage. For projects using C++, the New Relic library now properly marks our exported symbols as requiring C linkage.

**Fixes**

* Corrects an issue where data might cease reporting to New Relic after app has been running for 60 seconds.
* Fixes an issue that could cause incorrectly sized UIImages or repeating icons.

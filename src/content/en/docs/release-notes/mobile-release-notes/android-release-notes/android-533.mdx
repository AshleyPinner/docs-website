### Improvements

* This release adds two new Insights attributes for the upcoming [Mobile Version Trends Report](https://blog.newrelic.com/2015/11/12/mobile-version-trends-report/) : `install`, and `upgradeFrom`. This allows tracking when a session includes a new install or a new upgrade. The `install` attribute records `true` if the app was a new installation. The `upgradeFrom` attribute tracks the last version of the application when an upgrade is detected.

### Fixes

* Patched a GSON vulnerability that could result in null pointer exception in Json serialization during harvest.

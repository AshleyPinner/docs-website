### Bug fixes

* **Fixed issue with capturing AJAX status code in Angular apps:** Angular calls abort() on the XHR object after it successfully finishes. This was seen by our instrumentation as a call that did not finish, and as a result status code was set to `0` and reported as a network error. This fix addresses this use case by capturing status code before the call is aborted.

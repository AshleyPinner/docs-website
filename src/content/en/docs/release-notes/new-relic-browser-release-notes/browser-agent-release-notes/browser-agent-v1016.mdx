### Notes

The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.

### New features

* **Release ID API:** A new API allows you to uniquely identify your current JavaScript version, enabling a richer error feature with source maps identification. Stay tuned for more information and documentation!

### Improvements

* **Passive Scroll Event Listeners:** Previously, the wrapped scroll event listener did not take advantage of an available performance optimization: the passive annotation. By including this annotation, our wrapped scroll listener will allow a non-blocking, smooth scrolling action.

### Bug fixes

* **XHR With Credentials:** Previously, when the agent would send data using an XHR, it would feature-check the `withCredentials` property and set it to `true` if it was available. However, older versions of IE do not allow modification of the `withCredentials` property on unsent XHRs. The agent now wraps the property assignment in a try/catch block to prevent errors.

### How to upgrade

To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see [Upgrade Browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/upgrade-browser-agent).

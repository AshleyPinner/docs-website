### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changed

Add extra information on verbose logs. On each metrics post, an incremental counter and the timestamps of the submitted metrics are logged.

### Windows specific

Using a new endpoint for Agent identity retrieval to mitigate the hostname flipping issue.

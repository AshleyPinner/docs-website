### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released, including some internal improvements and bug fixes. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Improvements

* Slightly restructured the inventory cache to optimize its behavior when the agent identifier changes.

### Bug fixes

* Windows: Fixed a bug that avoids the submission of some metrics when the user changes the default namespace for Windows management instrumentation.
* Fixed an error that happens during the configuration parse of some Docker containers.

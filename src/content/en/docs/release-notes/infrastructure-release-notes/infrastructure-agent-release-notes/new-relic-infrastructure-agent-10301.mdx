### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See the document ["Update the Infrastructure agent"](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for instructions detailing how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

### Bug fixes

* Fixes a regression where `sestatus` would be called even if SELinux features were inactive.
* Log file set in config will no longer be overwritten during agent restart

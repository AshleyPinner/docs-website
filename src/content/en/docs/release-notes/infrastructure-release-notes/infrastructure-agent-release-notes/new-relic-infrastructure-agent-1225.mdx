### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Improvements

* Added replacement of on-host integration's remote entity-names; when a loopback address is found, it will be replaced with agent entity-name. This change will be applied in the entity key and the hostname metric field (if present), when the data comes from an integration using protocol V3. See [protocol V3 documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/protocol-v3.md) for further details.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed unreported processes issue caused by the inability to parse a different format of /proc//stat.
* Fixed a problem that caused the Windows agent to submit `os:"unknown"`.

#### Security updates

* Fixed a low security issue that caused the Windows agent to periodically access `C:\etc` folder.

### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* The agent now includes the AWS region in the [inventory](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure) data under metadata/system when running in an AWS VM.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bug on Debian 7 and Centos 5 where the agent would leave child processes running after receiving a service management stop instruction.

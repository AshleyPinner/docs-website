### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Support for [product_uuid and boot_id inventory](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure#data-collection) in the hostinfo (metadata/system) plugin. This is non-variance inducing inventory.

### Bug fixes

* No longer using dmidecode to gather hardware information. Please refer to [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-security#sources) for more details
* Various other bug fixes

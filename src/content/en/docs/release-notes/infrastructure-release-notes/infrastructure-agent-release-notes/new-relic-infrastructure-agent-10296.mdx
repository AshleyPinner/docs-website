### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See the document ["Update the Infrastructure agent"](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for instructions detailing how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

### Improvements

* Added config setting (`ca_bundle_file` and `ca_bundle_dir`) to enable users to specify a file location for a x509 certificate in .pem format to permit TLS communication with custom certificate authorities.

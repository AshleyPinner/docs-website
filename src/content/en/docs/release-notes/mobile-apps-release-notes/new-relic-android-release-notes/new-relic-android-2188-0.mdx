### Notes

The mobile apps now look more like our New Relic website as we have updated our fonts to match the site!

### Improvements

* Better flex filter support for Infrastructure
* New fonts
* Easier to use tooltips for charts
* Goto the Insights app to view your NRQL query from alert by tapping the NRQL

### Fixes

* Health status for Synthetics is fixed
* Time picker was setting itself to compare when pull to refresh
* Infrastructure flex filter was not always working correctly
* Tooltip difficult to dismiss on charts -- now only shows on horizontal drag

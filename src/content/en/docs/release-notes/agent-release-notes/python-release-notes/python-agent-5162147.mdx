## Notes

This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## Bug fixes

* **Fix invalid payloads generated when using serverless mode**

  When using serverless mode on the Python Agent versions v5.16.0 and v5.16.1, invalid serverless/lambda payloads were generated. The agent now generates the proper payloads in serverless mode.

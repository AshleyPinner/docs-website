### New features

* The `@newrelic/native-metrics` module is now an optional dependency of the agent.

  Now npm will attempt to install the module when the agent is installed. If it fails for whatever reason, the agent itself will still be installed correctly and the rest of the npm install will finish normally.

### Improvements

* Incorporated new features and fixes from 1.34.0, 1.35.1, and 1.36.0

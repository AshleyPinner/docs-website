### Improvements

* Agent now respects attribute type restrictions on trace/segment attributes, as well as error event/trace attributes.

### Bug fixes

* Fixes potential for `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error on Transaction/Trace end.
* Custom events no longer accept attributes with invalid types.

  The only attribute types accepted by the backend are `boolean`, `string`, and `number`; any attribute assigned to a custom event outside these types would be dropped on ingest. The agent now filters these attributes out, and logs out a helpful message detailing the issue.

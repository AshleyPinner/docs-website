### Notes

* Corrected a defect in the handling of uncaught exceptions

  This defect was surfaced in versions of node that did not have `process._fatalException`, namely v0.8. When an uncaught exception occurs, the agent now records the error and passes it along to the other uncaught exception handlers that have been registered. This was inverted before, passing along errors when there were no other error handlers present and rethrowing otherwise.

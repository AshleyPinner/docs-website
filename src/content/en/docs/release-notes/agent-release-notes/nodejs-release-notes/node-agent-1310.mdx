### New features

* The agent now collects [database instance information](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues) for PostgreSQL and Redis operations. This information (database server and database name) is displayed in transaction traces and slow query traces.

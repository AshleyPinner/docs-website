### Bug fixes

* Refactored config to log warning and disable distributed tracing if enabled in serverless mode, but missing required config setting.
* Serverless mode no longer sets different data collection limits.
* The agent will no longer crash the process in the event of unexpected calls to the harvest callback.
* Updated required config values when using distributed tracing in `serverless_mode` to only include `account_id`.

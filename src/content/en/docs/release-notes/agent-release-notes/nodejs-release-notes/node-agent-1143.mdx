### Notes

* Improved the Express instrumentation to be more defensive before doing property lookups, fixing a crash that could happen in an exceptional state.
* Improved logging when the New Relic agent cannot connect to New Relic servers.
* Make Cross Application Tracer header injection less aggressive fixing interaction with other libraries such as riak-js.

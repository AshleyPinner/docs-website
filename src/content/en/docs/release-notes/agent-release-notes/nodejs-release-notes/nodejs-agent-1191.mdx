### Notes

* Fixed a bug in native ES6 Promise instrumentation.

  Previously the Promise instrumentation would cause `instanceof Promise` to return false even if the object was a promise. This also caused an incompatibility with async-listener. `instanceof` checks will now work on both the wrapped and unwrapped Promise object.

### New features

* Added more HTTP request/response parameters to transactions.

  The agent now collects additional request/response HTTP headers (e.g. contentType, HTTP method, response status code). These can be used to filter and group errors in the Error analytics page, as well as events in Insights.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue with collecting errors when an Express error handler removed message and stack properties from the error object.

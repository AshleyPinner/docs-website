### Notes

* Names assigned to errors via `Error.name` now appear in the UI.

  > Previously, the name of an error in the UI appeared as `Error.constructor.name` or with a default of `Error`. Now the common pattern of `Error.name` is respected and takes precedence.
* Child segments of external calls will now be nested correctly.

  > This change causes segments that make up external calls to nest under the call correctly. Previously, the child segments appeared as siblings to external calls.
* The `request_uri` attribute on errors will now only include the path without any parameters.

  > This behavior now matches the other New Relic agents.

### New features

* Added capturing errors from the unhandledRejection global event.

  If a promise is rejected with an error, and the error is not handled, the error will now be reported to New Relic.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with attaching an event handler every time Express was required.
* Fixed issue with chained promises losing context.

  Previously the transaction state was getting lost when an error was thrown early in a promise chain.
* Fixed issue with the agent crashing when an http Server did not have the address() getter.
* Fixed issue with Express instrumentation when a wrapped layer object was missing a method.

### Improvements

* Added more logging around the CAT feature.

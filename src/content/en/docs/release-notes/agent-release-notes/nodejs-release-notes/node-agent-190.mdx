* We now support Cassandra via the `node-cassandra-cql` driver.

  New database instrumentation means that we can present you with the timing data for how long those queries take. Thanks to Aaron Silvas from GoDaddy for the initial implementation of the Cassandra instrumentation.
* Router queue time now supports `t=<number>` in the X-REQUEST-START and X-QUEUE-START headers.

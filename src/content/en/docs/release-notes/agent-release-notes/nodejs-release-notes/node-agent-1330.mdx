### New features

* The agent now collects database instance information for Memcached operations.

  This information (database server and database name) is displayed in transaction traces and slow query traces.

### Improvements

* socket.io long-polling requests are now ignored by default.

  Collecting metrics for these requests is typically not desirable since they are frequent and do not represent business transactions. Previously we recommended adding an ignore rule manually. Now it is included by default.
* Improved test coverage for Postgres and MongoDB instrumentations.

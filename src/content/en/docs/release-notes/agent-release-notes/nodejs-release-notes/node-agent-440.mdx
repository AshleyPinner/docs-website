### Improvements

* Replaced `trusted_account_ids` array with `trusted_account_key`.
* Added node v10 to the test matrix.

### Bug fixes

* Added config `utilization` env vars to the `BOOLEAN_VARS` set.

  This ensures that if these boolean config values are set outside of a config file, their values are respected, particularly when they are disabled.

### Fixes

* Updated use of `fs.unlink` without a callback to `fs.unlinkSync`.

  As of Node v10, the callback is [no longer optional](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_unlink_path_callback), which was causing a false test failure.
* Fixed access to properties on promisified methods.

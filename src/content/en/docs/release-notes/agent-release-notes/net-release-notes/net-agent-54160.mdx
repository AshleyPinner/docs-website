### New Features

* Added ServiceStack.Redis v3.x and v4.x framework support. The .Net agent now wraps time spent making ServiceStack.Redis API calls, which will appear as Datastore metrics and Transaction Trace segments in New Relic APM.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused web transaction data to be lost if the request contained an invalid "Referer" HTTP header.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the agent was not sending data to New Relic upon exit from a very short running application.
* Fixed a bug where parameterized SQL queries might cause an incorrect explain plan to be generated.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.

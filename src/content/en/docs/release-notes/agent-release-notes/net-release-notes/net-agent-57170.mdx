### Fixes

* Fixed a bug that caused certain frameworks (such as EpiServer CMS) to throw exceptions when trying to resolve a reference to JetBrains.
* Fixed a bug that caused ASMX web service exceptions to not be noticed. This would result in missing some error details, such as stack traces.
* Fixed a bug where sometimes transactions will not be reported if the `HttpClient` class is used during that transaction.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.

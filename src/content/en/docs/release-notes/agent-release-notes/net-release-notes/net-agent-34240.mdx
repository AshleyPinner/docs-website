**New Features**

* Provides visibility into Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) activity. Within a web transaction, e.g., you can now see whether a message has been sent to a queue, pulled off a queue, peeked at, or if a queue has been purged.

**Fixes**

* Fixes a crash in the New Relic system tray application that would occur for some users on launch.

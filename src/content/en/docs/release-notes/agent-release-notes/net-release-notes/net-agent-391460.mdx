End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### New Features

* Added support for agent-side creation of application labels and categories via [newrelic.config](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#labels) or the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable.

  Labeling enables organization of applications with labels and categories. The APM UI will use these labels and categories to group, filter and organize all your applications in a meaningful way; this is particularly useful if you have many applications. For more information, see [Labels and categories](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).

### Fixes

* Fixes a race condition that could lead to a small amount of missing data and in some rare cases, excessive CPU utilization. Most likely to occur with WCF applications under heavy load.
* Fixes a bug where turning on high security mode and turning off SQL would result in receiving obfuscated SQL.

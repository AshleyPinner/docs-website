### New Features

* Added instrumentation for RabbitMQ client versions 3.5 and above. For more information on which RabbitMQ operations are instrumented, see: [Compatibility and requirements for the .NET agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-net-agent).
* Added instrumentation for Couchbase client versions 2.x. For more information on which Couchbase operations are instrumented, see: [Compatibility and requirements for the .NET agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-net-agent).

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where MS SQL Server instrumentation would generate exceptions and disable itself when a connection string contained a port number.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).

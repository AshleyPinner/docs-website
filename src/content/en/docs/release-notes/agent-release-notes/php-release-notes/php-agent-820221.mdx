### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an entire category of bugs where a Drupal hook whose hook name matched its module name resulted in the generation of empty metric names.

### Operating Systems Support

* This release of the PHP Agent removes support for the Solaris operating system. For Solaris support, please install agent version 8.1 or prior.

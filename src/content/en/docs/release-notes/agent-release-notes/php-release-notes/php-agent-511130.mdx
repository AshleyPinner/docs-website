### New Features

With this release, the agent reports [TransactionError](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/error-event-default-attributes-insights) events. These new events power the beta feature [Advanced Analytics for APM Errors](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-errors-error-traces) (apply [here](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/join-the-apm-errors-beta-of-real-time-analytics/31123) to participate). The error events are also available through [New Relic Insights](http://newrelic.com/insights).

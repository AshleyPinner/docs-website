### New Features

* Support for PHP 7.2 has been added.

### Bug Fixes

* Datastore metrics would not be generated for Predis users who stopped and started the transaction after instantiating a `Predis\Client` object. This included users using the [`newrelic_set_appname()`](/docs/agents/php-agent/php-agent-api/newrelic_set_appname) API. This has been fixed.

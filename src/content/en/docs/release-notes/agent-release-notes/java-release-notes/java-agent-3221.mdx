### Fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused Ning's AsyncHttpClient WebSockets requests to fail, or the application not to start.
* Fixed an issue that could cause an extra transaction to be created, a background transaction named NettyDispatcher.
* Removed the deprecated bootstrap.classpath configuration, as it could result in the Java agent's instrumentation failing to load.

### Fixes

<Callout variant="important">

### Known issues

* X-ray sessions sometimes return no transaction traces. Many x-ray session runs can cause a memory leak.
* Play framework

  * Higher overhead with Play 2 than later releases.
  * Does not work properly with Play 2.2
  * Counts `akka.actor.ActorKilledException` as an error.
  * Play transaction does not complete until timeout expires
  * When using Play, `ignoreTransaction` call does not take effect
* In some cases running Weblogic, the Java agent fails certificate validation when connecting to New Relic. This may require a [workaround](#workaround).
* This release contains some inconsistencies in the instrumentation of Hibernate across versions.
* This release requires a [workaround](#workaround) to use SSL with WebSphere.
* Potential memory leak when app continually creates ClassLoaders.
* Rare memory leak if agent does not report to New Relic for an extended period.

New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system, and how to improve it.

With New Relic, you can:

* **[Bring all your data together](#bring-your-data):** Instrument everything and import data from across your technology stack using our agents, integrations, and APIs, and access it from a single UI.
* [**Analyze your data**](#analyze-your-data): Get all your data at your fingertips to find the root causes of problems and optimize your systems. Build dashboards and charts or use our powerful query language.
* **[Respond to incidents quickly](#respond-faster)**: Our machine learning solution proactively detects and explains anomalies and warns you before they become problems.
* [**Develop New Relic apps**](#develop): Create your own New Relic One applications to suit the needs of your team or company. Use our extensive development resources to reduce development time.

## All the answers in one place

New Relic is built for [Full-Stack Observability](/docs/introduction-full-stack-observability). It links all relevant data so that you get the whole picture of everything that enables your systems to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button.

Monitoring vs Observability: New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place.

As just one example of what you can do with New Relic, imagine you are a Kubernetes administrator overseeing many clusters and pods of software containers. Where do you start troubleshooting? This short video shows how you can locate a problem cluster and drill through transaction traces to relevant logs:

## Bring all your data together

Capture, organize, and make sense of your data in [our Telemetry Data Platform](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/get-started-telemetry-data-platform)—no matter where it comes from. Use our [agents and integrations](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relic-integrations) to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools, or use [our APIs](/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis) for data that’s more specific to your business or technology.

If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see a larger list at [New Relic integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations).

As a [full user](/docs/users-roles#user-type) you get access to our entire set of observability tools in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one):

* [Application monitoring](/docs/apm)
* [Browser monitoring](/docs/browser)
* [Mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring)
* [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics)
* [Serverless monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring)
* [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure)
* [Log management](/docs/logs)

You can start anywhere, but you'll never get lost: full-stack observability means that you're in control.

## Analyze your data

With your data [secure](/docs/security/new-relic-security/compliance/data-encryption) at New Relic, our platform can alert you to problems and help you organize, process, and understand your data, whether it's [metrics, events, logs, or traces](https://newrelic.com/platform/telemetry-data-101/ "Link opens in a new window."):

* [Explore your data visually](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer): Jump into our data explorer to navigate all your data and make connections between your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) without any knowledge of query languages.
* [Query and visualize your data:](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) Use our curated dashboard visualizations or create your own. Use [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) (New Relic Query Language) to slice and dice your data and dig deeper into questions.
* [Query your data programmatically:](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor.

## Respond to incidents faster

DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently.

* Let [Applied Intelligence](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/introduction-new-relic-ai), our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents.
* [Proactive detection](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/proactive-detection-new-relic-ai): Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them.
* [Get notifications:](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts) Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified.

## Develop with New Relic

With New Relic you can build your own observability app to answer unique business, IT, and operational questions, using the same data that you brought in.

We’ve made it easy to build custom applications on top of New Relic: Go to our [Developers website](http://developer.newrelic.com/) and start creating your app! You may even [share it with the world](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/publish-deploy)!

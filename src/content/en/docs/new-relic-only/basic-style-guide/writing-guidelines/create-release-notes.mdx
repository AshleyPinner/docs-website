The Docs site has two kinds of release notes:

* **Agent release notes** (for downloadable, versioned New Relic software)
* **Platform release notes** (for other SaaS-based software like UI changes)

Review the recommended [best practices for New Relic release notes](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/best-practices-for-release-notes). Then, to add either type of release note to the site:

1. Create a new release note:
   * To clone an existing release note as a template: From the release note you want to clone, select **Clone content** below the **Page tools** menu bar. Ensure you update the title, version numbers, dates, and download links.
   * To create a new note: From the Drupal menu bar, select **Shortcuts > Add content > Add agent release notes** or **Add platform release notes**. Use the placeholder text as a starting template for your note.
2. Fill out the required fields for either release note type:

               <Callout variant="important">
                 The Docs site has a known bug with release notes that affects the first line's formatting. To work around this, ensure your first line includes `<h3>` tags (`###` in Markdown); for example, `### Notes`.

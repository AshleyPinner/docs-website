The Docs site uses content versioning to track changes within individual docs. When you select a document to edit, Drupal creates a new draft version, and tracks all changes within that draft until it is published. When anyone edits it again, Drupal creates a new version to track the changes since publication.

Each document has two **Moderation** pages to look at revisions: **History** and **Compare revisions**. This is basically the equivalent of "diffing" changes in code branches.

## View history of a doc's changes

Each document on the Docs site has a **History** page that lists the revisions for that document. It lists the complete history of changes to each node, with the most recent version listed first.

From this page, you can:

* View any history version of the document.
* See who made changes when.
* Revert to earlier versions of the document.
* Delete a specific version of a document.

To access the document's **History** page:

1. From the document, select the **Moderate** tab.
2. From the Workbench, select **List revisions**.

**(page) > Moderate:** The Drupal **Revision history** lists each version of a document in reverse chronological order.

## Compare content revisions

Each document on the site has a **Compare revisions** page that lists the revisions for that document. It lists the complete history of changes to each node, with the most recent version listed first.

From this page, you can:

* Compare any two versions of the document.
* See who made changes when.
* Revert to earlier versions of the document.
* Delete a specific version of a document.

To compare revisions:

1. From the document, select the **Moderate > Compare revisions** tab.
2. From the Workbench, select **Compare revisions**.
3. Select the radio buttons for the two versions you want to compare.
4. Select **Compare**.
5. To scroll through additional revisions, select **Previous difference** or **Next difference**.

Drupal displays a table with a color-coded, side-by-side diff report.

**(page) > Moderate > Compare revisions:** Use this page to compare any two versions of a document.

## Schedule content revisions

Before you can schedule a publication for individual revisions, you need the revision number. This is the first column in the [**Moderation history**](#comparing) table. Typically this will be the most recent revision and the first item in the list on the scheduling page.

To schedule a revision:

1. From the **Moderation history** page, select **Schedule**.
2. Select **Add scheduled revision**.
3. From the **Revision** dropdown, select the version to be scheduled.
4. From the **Operation** dropdown, select **Moderate to published**.
5. Assign a date and time.
6. Select **Schedule**.

  From here you can also schedule documents to unpublish and auto-delete.

## Revert content revisions

If a draft gets published by mistake, you can revert the changes back to any previous version from either of the document moderation pages. To revert to a previous version of the document:

1. [Compare revisions](#comparing) to confirm you are looking at the correct versions.
2. Select **View** for the version you are **reverting to**, and make sure you are reverting to the correct vesion.
3. Select **Revert** for the version you are reverting to.
4. Publish your changes.

## Delete content versions

You should not need to delete content versions. However, there may be mistakes or abandoned drafts you don't want to accidentally publish.

You only delete active drafts from **Compare revisions**. You cannot delete the currently published revision. Instead, you must [revert the currently published version](#reverting) to a previous revision.

To delete a **draft** version of the document:

1. From **Compare revisions**, make sure the version to be deleted is not the most recently published revision.
2. Select **Delete** for the draft version you want to delete, and confirm.

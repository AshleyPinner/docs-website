This doc will explain required styles and recommended phrasings for pricing-related requirements.

## Style requirements and recommendations

When you document a pricing tier-related restriction, use the following approach:

* When documenting features present in the [Pro and Enterprise tiers](https://newrelic.com/pricing), add tier requirements in a "requirements" section of the doc, with wording like: "This requires [Pro or Enterprise tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing)" or even just "Pro or Enterprise tier" ([as shown in this doc](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains)). Only add pricing-related wording for the specific features that Pro and Enterprise tier give access to; this is a fairly small set of features.
* As a general rule, place the pricing tier requirement in a single location and avoid putting it in multiple paragraphs.
* Regarding the [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): At this point, only add tier-related requirements for the New Relic One pricing plan, not the original plan. The original pricing plan will be more and more de-emphasized over time as more customers get on the new pricing plan, so there shouldn't be much need to edit original pricing plan docs.

## Explanations of philosophy

Here are some reasons behind the approach we take:

* For the New Relic One pricing plan, there are several [pricing factors involved](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#how-pricing-works). As a general approach, the only pricing factor we document is that related to the [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, and Enterprise). This is because the New Relic platform is much more open now, with user type (basic vs full user) being the main factor in gating platform functionality. And in those cases, it should usually be obvious (via UI upsells and notes) why things are off-limits. With that in mind, we are aiming for a minimal approach to mentioning pricing-related requirements.
* The main exception to the above point is for features provided by [Pro and Enterprise tiers](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (this is mainly admin functionalities like SAML SSO set up, or ability to create custom user roles, but also things like more synthetic monitor checks and increased data retention periods). Because there are only a few things in the Pro and Enterprise tiers, we should only have to do this infrequently.

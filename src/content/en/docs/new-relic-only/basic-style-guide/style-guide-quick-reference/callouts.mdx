NR ONLY

Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. However, if there are too many callouts in your doc, it makes it confusing what exactly matters the most.

Avoid littering your doc with an excessive number of callouts, because they can quickly distract readers. Instead, use them judiciously. **Recommendation:** Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed.

## Types of callouts

Here is an example of the `callout` format:

```
<div class="callout-tip">
  <p>Enclose your callouts in division tags.</p>
</div>
```

The Docs site uses these callout classes:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="tr-caution"
    title={<>Caution (<InlineCode>callout-caution</InlineCode>)</>}
  >
    **Cautions** scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the `callout-caution` class. At a traffic light, a **Caution** would be red.

    <Callout variant="caution">
      Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-important"
    title={<>Important (<InlineCode>callout-important</InlineCode>)</>}
  >
    **Important** notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the `callout-important` class. At a traffic light, an **Important** note would be yellow.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-tip"
    title={<>Tip (<InlineCode>callout-tip</InlineCode>)</>}
  >
    **Tips** whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but it is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the `callout-tip` class. At a traffic light, a **Tip** would be a green light.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you have integrated your New Relic account with a [ticketing system](/docs/site/ticketing-integrations) such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-permissions"
    title="User-related permissions"
  >
    For recommended wording, see [User-related language and styles](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/style-guide-quick-reference/user-related-language-styles-recommended-phrasings).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="tr-pricing"
    title={<>Pricing (<InlineCode>callout-pricing</InlineCode>) <strong>Do not use.</strong></>}
  >
    **Pricing** callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the `callout-pricing` class.

    Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Access to this feature depends on your [subscription level](http://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing).
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

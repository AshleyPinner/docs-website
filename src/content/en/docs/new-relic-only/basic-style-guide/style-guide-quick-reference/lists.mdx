NR ONLY

Follow these conventions for using bullet point lists:

* Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item.
* Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters.
* Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information.
* Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point.
* Use tables when your ordered or unordered list benefits from extra detail.

  For punctuation guidelines, follow the **[Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists),** which includes considerations for localization.

Here is an example of an ordered list as a table. Because each step is a row, the table helps to structure the levels of detail.

## In-line lists

As an an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: [C SDK](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications) \| [Go](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/go-agent/features/distributed-tracing-go#create-manually) \| [Java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/api-guides/guide-using-java-agent-api#trace-calls).

This should mainly be used for situations where:

* You are linking to further documentation.
* Customers will likely be selecting a single option.
* The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure).

Reasons for using this format over a bullet point list may be:

* When you think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space. This may happen in circumstances where a procedure must include several lists. Here's [one example of this](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#enable).
* Where there are only two or three potential options they'll be choosing and a bullet point list seems unnecessary. Here's [an example](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/introduction-net-agent-install#requiremnts).

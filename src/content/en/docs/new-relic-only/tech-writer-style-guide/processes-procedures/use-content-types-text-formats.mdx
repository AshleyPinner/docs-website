NR ONLY

This describes the content types used on New Relic's Docs site, text formats available in Drupal, and the document structure.

## Content types

For most situations, use the **Basic page** content type.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Content type**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Basic page
      </td>

      <td>
        A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        API doc
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see [apiStyleGuidelines](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/writing-guidelines/apistyleguidelines-example-agent-api) (for style guidelines) and [Work with the API doc content type](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/working-api-doc-content-type) (for how to use and configure).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Attribute definition
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see [Work with attribute definition content type](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/work-attribute-definition-content-type).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Landing pages
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see [Working with landing pages](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/working-landing-pages).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Platform release notes
      </td>

      <td>
        This format includes specific fields for UI-centric release notes. For more information, see [Work with platform release notes content type](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/content-types/work-platform-release-note-content-type).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Release notes
      </td>

      <td>
        This format includes specific fields for release notes.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Troubleshooting doc
      </td>

      <td>
        This format is for troubleshooting docs in a Problem-Solution-Cause format. For more information, see [Troubleshooting docs guide](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/article-templates/troubleshooting-docs-guide).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Text editing formats

Select your preferred text editing mode for your document's body. Options include:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Text editing type**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        HTML
      </td>

      <td>
        The default editing mode, useful for quick edits and cosmetic changes. To toggle between WYSIWYG and HTML views, select the **Page Contents** toolbar's **Source** button.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Markdown
      </td>

      <td>
        Markdown functionality is limited, especially for managing images and atoms. Avoid using Markdown for new documents.

        <Callout variant="caution">
          Do not switch between Markdown and HTML (unless deliberately converting a Markdown document to HTML). Drupal will eat your code by trying to "helpfully" format it. What it spits out will not be pleasant.
        </Callout>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="plaintext">
      <td>
        Plain text
      </td>

      <td>
        The raw HTML source of a document. To make editing easier, copy and paste the document into your favorite plain text editor (such as Sublime Text), then paste it back in when done.

        Avoid switching between plain text and HTML from **Text format**. Changing edit modes there can corrupt the code. Instead, to toggle between plain text and HTML views, select the **Page Contents** toolbar's **Source** button.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Meta content fields

When creating a new document, fill in metadata, including:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Meta content field**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Title
      </td>

      <td>
        Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, "AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls." In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it is a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:).

        The title will automatically be converted to a file name, lower case, punctuation removed, with dashes between words. You can override this by creating aliases and redirects at the bottom of the page.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Short title (optional)
      </td>

      <td>
        Use to abbreviate the title that appears in the side menu. If not used, Drupal defaults to the Title.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Keywords
      </td>

      <td>
        Provide a list of keywords separated by commas that describe the nature of the document and enhance search engine optimization (SEO).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Description (maximum 160 characters)
      </td>

      <td>
        When summarizing the document's content, always try to include "New Relic." The description is the document's elevator speech for SEO. What will make people invest in the document by clicking through to it? What will help readers quickly identify if this document answers their question?
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        MetaRobots (optional)
      </td>

      <td>
        To prevent non-public pages from being crawled, assign `robot.txt` restrictions.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Document body

The document body is where you edit the page content. The edit space is resizable, and the WYSIWYG editor has a full screen mode. Use the WYSIWYG **Source** icon to access the raw HTML.

The default mode is WYSIWYG, but Drupal will open the document in whatever mode was last used to save it. To change the mode, save your current edits, and then reopen the document and select from the dropdown below the edit window.

## Permissions and navigation

When creating a new document, fill in the file location and permissions at the bottom. These meta data fields are used by the documentation server to build navigation pages:

* **User Access** determines who can see the document.
* **Page Location** and **Sort Order** determine where pages occur in menus.
* **Goals** is an alternate categorization that will be used by faceted search to help users filter content they are looking for.

## Tabs

You should only need to change values in the tabs at the bottom of the page when you need to set something as an exception to the default.

* Menu settings
* URL path settings
* URL redirects
* Book outline
* Comment settings
* Scheduling options
* Authoring information
* Publishing options (useful to include related JIRA or other comments here)

NR ONLY

<Callout variant="important">
  If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel or send an email to [docs@newrelic.com](mailto:docs@newrelic.com).
</Callout>

Follow our [security requirements for images](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/docs-site-security-guidelines-for-images). Also:

* Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance.
* Include a caption with helpful context for the image.
* For screenshot captions, include the path in bold.
* For video captions, include the approximate running time.

## Manage images

In Drupal, images are stored in an assets library as objects called **Atoms**.

To go to the assets library, click **Manage > Contents > Atoms** or go directly to the [Atoms Library](/admin/content/atoms). Once there, use filters and search to find the image you need.

For your convenience, the assets library is also available in the Drupal image module when you're editing a doc.

![The Drupal image module for uploading and embedding images](./images/drupal-image-module.png "drupal-image-module.png")

By default, the image module is collapsed on the right side of the screen. Click the search dot to expand it.

## Embed an image

To embed an image in a document:

1. In WYSIWYG mode, click the search dot to open the image module.
2. Find your image.
3. Click and drag the image into your doc.
4. Switch to source mode, then copy and paste the div class `dnd-atom-wrapper` content where you'd like the image to go in your doc.
5. Switch back to WYSIWIG mode to make sure the image looks right.

    <div class="dnd-atom-wrapper type-image context-inline_image" contenteditable="false">
    	<div class="dnd-drop-wrapper"><!-- scald=9641:sdl_editor_representation -->
    		<div class="image"><img alt="<var>Image alt text</var>" height="1794" src="https://docs-staging.newrelic.com/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/<var>image-name</var>.png" title="<var>image-name</var>.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="2868" /></div>
    	<!-- END scald=9641 --></div>
	
    <div class="dnd-legend-wrapper" contenteditable="true">
    	<div class="meta">It's helpful to screenshot captions with the UI path. Write a caption that helps the reader understand the context for the image and why it's important.</div>
    		</div>
    	</div>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Format an image

Additional image formatting options are available.

1. Right-click the image and click **Edit atom properties**.
2. Click the **Contexts** field, then select **Full Column 700px Image** to use the popup lightbox. You'll use this for anything wider than 700 pixels.
3. For images you want to show as is, select **Editor representation**.

## Update an image

The assets library content is shared across the site. If you update an image, it'll be updated everywhere it appears. In general, it's easiest to update images directly in the assets library at **Manage > Contents > Atoms**.

To replace an image:

1. Find the image to be swapped.
2. Click **Edit**, then click **Remove**.
3. Upload the new image.

If the new image needs to go out immediately, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel. We'll get it updated right away. Otherwise, the image will be updated sometime within the hour as Drupal refreshes its caches.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If the image you wanted to change was hard to find, add some tags to the description to help the next person find it.
</Callout>

## Write image captions

Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example:

![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png "NR1-dashboards-image.png")

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see [Guidelines for explaining images.](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images#identify-images)

## Add an inline image

The process for adding an inline image is different than the standard embedded image:

1. Add the image to a page.
2. In source view, delete all the div classes around the image tag.
3. Remove the protocol and server from the path, making it a local link. For example, `https://docs.newrelic.com/IMAGE_PATH/image.png` would become `/IMAGE_PATH/image.png`.
4. If the image isn't much bigger than the line height: in source view, assign the class **as-char** to it. This will strip away the formatting and align the image to the text.

When you remove the `div` tags from around the image, the asset manager will no longer render it as an embedded image. The image won't be updated automatically when you update it in the asset library, but it will still function as a normal image tag on the page. The final result should look something like this:

```
From the Overview page, select your app's gear <img src="/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/icon-settings.png" alt="icon-settings.png" class="as-char" title="icon-settings.png" /> icon.
```

If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word "icon" in the text. For example, "select your app's gear ![icon-settings.png](./images/icon-settings.png "icon-settings.png") icon."

You can use the same sort of approach for any image you want to work with manually.

## Add a fixed width, block level image

Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes.

Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image.

To add a fixed width, block level image:

1. Add an image like you would with an inline image.
2. After removing the div classes around the image tag, put the `<img>` tag inside a parent `<div>` tag. Don't add the `as-char` class.
3. Add the inline style `width:100%; max-width:ORIGINAL_IMG_WIDTH` to the `<img>`'s parent `<div>` and the caption `<div>`.

Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image:

```
<div style="width: 100%; max-width: Npx;">
	   <img alt="ALT TEXT" height="X" src="IMG_URL" title="FILENAME" width="N">
	</div>
	
	<div class="dnd-legend-wrapper" style="width: 100%; max-width: Npx;">
	   <div class="meta"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div>
	</div>
```

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title="Example image HTML and output">
    The following HTML outputs the image below. Because we knew the image width is 413 pixels, we set that as the max-width on the div that contains the `<img>` tag and the caption's parent element `div.dnd-legend-wrapper`.

    ```
    <div style="width: 100%; max-width: 413px;"><img alt="Web application throughput chart" height="521" src="https://docs.newrelic.com/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/Web_app_throughput.png" title="Web_app_throughput.png" width="413"></div>
    <div class="dnd-legend-wrapper" style="width: 100%; max-width: 413px;">
    	   <div class="meta"><p><b>APM &gt; (selected app) &gt; Monitoring &gt; Overview:</b> You can use the New Relic REST API (v2) to return the average <b>Throughput</b> value that appears on your app's <b>Overview</b> page.</p></div>
    	</div>
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Add Font Awesome 4.7 icons

You can also add icons from the [Font Awesome 4.7 library](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/). When using an icon in text, always describe it first. When you embed the icon, follow it with the word "icon" in the text. For example, "select the delete icon."

The code for that phrase is:

```
delete <i class="fa fa-trash-o"><span>fa-trash-o</span></i> icon
```

Replace `fa-trash-o` with the [icon identifier](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) for the icon you're using. Make sure you include the icon identifier inside `<span>` tags. Don't make icons bold.

You can also color Font Awesome icons to more closely match the New Relic user interface. For example, the trash can icon in New Relic Insights is blue: "select the delete icon."

To set the color of an icon, use the HTML `style="color:#HEXCOLOR"` declaration:

```
delete <i class="fa fa-trash-o" style="color:#8FAADA"><span>fa-trash-o</span></i> icon
```

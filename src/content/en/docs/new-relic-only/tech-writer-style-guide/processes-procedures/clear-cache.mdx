NR ONLY

The docs site caches some of its content in a variety of ways. This means that changes to the taxonomy/navigation will sometimes take a little while to show up to some or all users. This doc explains how to clear the cache so that changes to the docs site show up for users immediately.

## Clear the site cache

<Callout variant="important">
  Clearing the cache may result in performance decrease while cache is rebuilt. Clear the cache only if you are publishing a taxonomy-related change that you think is important users see immediately.
</Callout>

To clear the cache:

1. From Drupal menu bar, go to: **Manage > Configuration > Development > Performance**.
2. Select **Clear all caches**.

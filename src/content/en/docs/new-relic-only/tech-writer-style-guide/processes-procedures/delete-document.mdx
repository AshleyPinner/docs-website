<Callout variant="caution">
  When you delete a document, its content and all redirects to it are completely and irreversibly deleted. If you believe the document may be of use in the future, OR if you do not want to re-create its redirects, consider another method to [hide the document](/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/processes-procedures/hiding-content) from public view.

If you are certain you want to delete a Drupal document, follow the steps below or watch our 16 minute [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eeN9HZT5MCPE_-qx1Ef4AFycsp0O_lLV/view?usp=sharing):

1. From your Okta login, locate the document you want to delete on the Docs site, and select **Edit**.
2. Copy all the source HTML and save it to a Jira for safekeeping (in case we need it again).
3. Check whether the doc you want to delete and the doc you want to redirect it to [have both been translated](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/manage-translated-docs#translation-status). If yes, notify the [Tech Docs team's liaison for translation projects](https://newrelic.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-6596).
4. Copy the following information from the document you plan to delete into a temporary text file:
   * In **URL path settings:** Copy the URL alias for the document you are about to delete.
   * In the browser address bar: Copy `node/` and the number that follows (for example, `node/10796`).
   * In **URL redirects:** Copy each path under **From** (for example, `docs/enable-infinite-tracing)`. (Or, for each existing redirect click **Edit** and update the destination node.)
5. At the bottom of the page, click **Delete**, then confirm the deletion of the file.
6. Go to the document you want to redirect users to, and open it in the Drupal editor.
7. Click **URL redirects**, and then click **Add URL redirect to this content**.
8. Copy the first value from your temporary redirects text file into **From**, and then select **Save**.
9. Repeat this redirect routine, adding the remaining nodes and/or paths to to create individual redirects.

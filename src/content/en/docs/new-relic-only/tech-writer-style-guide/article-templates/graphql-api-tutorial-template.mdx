  **This is a template.** The finalized version of this GraphQL doc should include: an introduction paragraph that highlights why a customer would want to query this data, and 3-5 query examples that show interesting data that can be derived from GraphQL.
</Callout>

**Sample intro paragraph**: You can use the [New Relic GraphQL API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/introduction-new-relic-graphql) to \[add key use cases here]. To construct these queries and see responses, you can use the [New Relic GraphQL Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql). This document explains some of the available functions for querying \[data to be queried].

## Example query #1 with GraphQL

Add a description here for your example query. Tell the customer why they want to query this kind of data. Fill out the first block with your code, and the second with the data returned by the query:

```
{
   actor {
      account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO") {
            results
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This query returns the following:

```
{
   "data": {
      "actor": {
         "account": {
            "nrql": {
               "results": [
                 {
                  "count": 1000
                 }
                ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The actual value of the count varies depending on your data. Use the [New Relic GraphQL Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to experiment with queries.

## Example query #2 with GraphQL

Add a description here for your example query. Tell the customer why they want to query this kind of data. Fill out the first block with your code, and the second with the data returned by the query:

```
{
   actor {
      account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO") {
            results
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This query returns the following:

```
{
   "data": {
      "actor": {
         "account": {
            "nrql": {
               "results": [
                 {
                  "count": 1000
                 }
                ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The actual value of the count varies depending on your data. Use the [New Relic GraphQL Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) to experiment with queries.

## Example query #3 with GraphQL

Add a description here for your example query. Tell the customer why they want to query this kind of data. Fill out the first block with your code, and the second with the data returned by the query:

```
{
   actor {
      account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) {
         nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO") {
            results
         }
      }
   }
}
```

This query returns the following:

```
{
   "data": {
      "actor": {
         "account": {
            "nrql": {
               "results": [
                 {
                  "count": 1000
                 }
                ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Begin with a short, meaningful introduction about the document's purpose. For example:

The contents of this doc give helpful tips on page structure basics for New Relic's Docs site. Replace them with your content. To see the template's source code: From the editor toolbar below **Page Contents**, select **Source**.

## Section example

Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The Docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation.

If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to [security requirements](https://newrelic.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-8362), the Docs team manages all images on the Docs site.

## Code example

```
def article_url(category, article, options={})
url_for(options.reverse_merge(
  :controller => 'articles';,
  :action => 'show',
  :category => category,
  :article => article
))
end
```

## List example

Use ordered lists `ol` for steps in a multi-step procedure. For example:

1. Add `require('newrelic');` as the first line of your app's main module.
2. Use the command `npm install newrelic --save` for each application you want to monitor.

For all other lists, use unordered (bulleted) lists `ul` or [clamshells.](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/clamshells)

## Table example

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Item**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Requirements**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Some thing
      </td>

      <td>
        More detailed information about it
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Another thing
      </td>

      <td>
        More detailed information about it
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## For more help

This is sample text for the **For more help** section. If there are no links to include, remove the text but leave the **For more help** H2. The Docs site automatically fills customized footer content.

Additional documentation resources include:

* `<a href>Link to relevant page</a>` (useful description)

This is a template for an Infrastructure integration doc.

**Recommendation:** To make a new doc, simply [clone an existing integration doc](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/integrations) that is most similar to the new integration. (Note: Kubernetes and StatsD are both very different from other on-host integrations; do not clone those.)

## Intro (this heading not visible)

Example text:

[New Relic Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) provides a MySQL integration for reporting MySQL data to New Relic products. This document explains how to install and configure the MySQL integration and describes the data collected.

## Features

Any big-picture information about the integration, including what valuable data it reports and use cases it solves.

Consider providing a screenshot of a dashboard.

Example text for the CloudFront integration:

[Amazon CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) is an Amazon web service that speeds up the distribution of your web content. With New Relic's CloudFront integration, you can track CloudFront data in [New Relic Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure), including error rates, request counts, and uploaded/downloaded bytes. You can also track your CloudFront configuration and status information and see how configuration changes impact performance. And you can use [New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/introduction-aws-integrations#insights), you can create custom queries of your CloudFront integration data and custom charts.

## Compatibility and requirements

Example text:

Requirements include:

* New Relic Infrastructure [installed on host](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation).
* Linux distribution [compatible with New Relic Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).
* MySQL version 5.6 or higher.

## Activate (for on-host: "Install")

Info on installing and/or activating the integration. See integration doc similar to yours.

**For cloud:** should include link back to the general install/activate doc: ([Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations), [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-services-infrastructure))

**For on-host:** Explain how to install the integration ([example](/docs/oracledb-monitoring-integration#install)).

At end of this section, if there is a troubleshooting section, put: For help solving integration activation issues, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshoot).

## Configure

**This section only applies to on-host.** Info about how to configure an integration's config file and settings (not to be confused with cloud integrations' configuration info, which is sometimes reported as inventory data).

For an example on-host integration configuration section, see the [Kafka integration doc](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka-monitoring-integration#config).

## Polling frequency (for cloud integrations)

**For cloud only**. Recommendation: use the format of the integration doc your integration is closest to.

Example for AWS Auto Scaling integration:

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

[Default polling](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS ALB integration:

* New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute by default

## Find and use data

Info about where the integration data is found in New Relic, including the Insights event type used. Some integrations will have multiple things to say about events and/or 'provider' values; some will be quite simple.

Example text for DynamoDB integration:

To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to **[infrastructure.newrelic.com](https://infrastructure.newrelic.com) > Integrations > Amazon Web Services** and select one of the AWS DynamodDB integration links.

In [New Relic Insights](/docs/insights), data is attached to the `DatastoreSample` [event type](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#event), with a `provider` value of `DynamoDbTable`.

For more on how to find and use integration data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data

An introduction to the metric data. Sometimes this will be split into different h3 sections. Mention metric prefixes if relevant. If these metrics are exactly defined elsewhere (like on a service's site), summarize the metric in our docs and link in the introduction to those complete definitions. Note a table only has two columns: Metric and Description. Include as much relevant info about basic type of data in the Description (such as measurement units, that it's a rate/percentage, etc.). Put metric names and metric values in code format.

Example intro:

Here are the metrics reported by the MySQL integration. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator, such as `net.` or `server.`.

Example metric data table:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "375px" }}>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `volumeTotalReadTime`
      </td>

      <td>
        Total read time in seconds.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `db.allMemtablesOffHeapSizeBytes`
      </td>

      <td>
        Total number of bytes stored in the memtables (2i and pending flush memtables included) that resides on-heap.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `query.rangeSliceUnavailablesPerSecond`
      </td>

      <td>
        Number of unavailable exceptions encountered per second when processing token range read requests.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `burstBalance`
      </td>

      <td>
        Percentage of I/O credits (for gp2) or throughput credits (for st1 and sc1) remaining in the burst bucket.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `cluster.slaveRunning`
      </td>

      <td>
        Boolean. This is `1` if this server is a replication slave that is connected to a replication master, and both the I/O and SQL threads are running; otherwise, it is `0`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Inventory data

The inventory section can vary a good amount, depending on the type of integration and what it reports.

**Example of very brief inventory section,** taken from the [Cassandra doc](/docs/infrastructure/integrations/cassandra-integration-new-relic-infrastructure):

The integration captures configuration options defined in the Cassandra config file.

**Example of brief inventory section,** with links to relevant service documentation, taken from [AWS IAM integration doc](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-iam-monitoring-integration):

This integration reports the following IAM configuration options as inventory data:

_Below are several different types of ways of formatting inventory sections._

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Inventory data
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `/group`
      </td>

      <td>
        High level information about the [Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_Group.html) and detailed information on the [group attributes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GroupDetail.html).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `/server-certificate`
      </td>

      <td>
        Information about the [server certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ServerCertificate.html).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `/virtual-mfa`
      </td>

      <td>
        Information about the [virtual MFA device](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_VirtualMFADevice.html).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

**Example of inventory with more details/descriptions:**

The DynamoDB integration reports these configuration options as inventory data:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Inventory category
      </th>

      <th>
        Item and description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **/budgets**
      </td>

      <td>
        `name`: The name of a budget. Unique within accounts.

        `startTime`: Start date for the period of time covered by a budget.

        `endTime`: End date for the period of time covered by a budget.

        `limitAmount`: The total amount of cost or usage that you want to track with a budget as an upper limit.

        `limitUnit`: The unit of measurement used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

        `timeUnit`: The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. Valid values: monthly, quarterly, annually.

        `type`: Whether this budget tracks monetary cost or usage.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **/budgets/costFilters**
      </td>

      <td>
        `name`: The name of a budget. Unique within accounts.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Other system data

Any non-inventory, non-performance system/host data.

Example text, taken from MySQL integration:

The MySQL integration collects the following general attributes about the MySQL service:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "180px" }}>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.edition`
      </td>

      <td>
        `software.edition` takes the value of the MySQL `version_comment` variable.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `software.version`
      </td>

      <td>
        The MySQL server version.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `cluster.nodeType`
      </td>

      <td>
        Either `master` or `slave,` depending on the role of the MySQL node being monitored.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

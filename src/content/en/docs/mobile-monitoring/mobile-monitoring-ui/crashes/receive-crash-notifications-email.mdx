When your mobile app has a new kind of crash, you want to know what went wrong so you can prevent that type of error in the future. New Relic Mobile emails you when a unique crash is detected.

This document describes how to enable/disable crash reports, either for yourself or for an entire app.

## View crash reporting settings

To see crash reporting settings:

1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/mobile](https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile) > [(account dropdown)](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > User preferences**.
2. Look at the **Mobile crash reporting** section.

## Turn notifications on/off for your personal account

To turn crash report notifications on or off for your own account:

1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/mobile](https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile) > [(account dropdown)](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > User preferences**.
2. From the **Mobile crash reporting** section, toggle the box for **I want to receive email notifications for new crashes**.
3. Select **Save email preferences**.

The email notification will provide information about the selected mobile app's crash, as well as a direct link to the [crash report](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/investigate-mobile-app-crash-report) in the New Relic Mobile user interface.

If you are not receiving notifications when you expect them, it may be because an Admin or Owner has [disabled the app's crash reporting](#enable-apps).

## Turn crash reporting on/off for an entire app

When you set up New Relic Mobile to monitor an app, you will receive crash reports by default. You can disable these notifications on a per-app basis for all users in your account:

1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/mobile](https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile) > [(account dropdown)](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > User preferences**.
2. Under the **Mobile crash reporting** section, mouse over a mobile app name and you will see **Edit application settings**. Select it.
3. This will take you to the application's [**Settings** UI page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/maintenance/customizing-your-mobile-app-settings). Toggle the **Enable crash report emails for this application** checkbox.

## Problem

The .NET agent has been installed and the required **App Settings** are set, but no data appears, and no New Relic logs are created in `D:\Home\Logfiles\NewRelic\`. In addition, when you use the Azure Kudu console's **Process Explorer** to inspect your application's **Environment Variables**, it shows the `COR_PROFILER_PATH_64` and `COR_PROFILER_PATH_32` are set and pointing to the following:

```
D:\Program Files (x86)\SiteExtensions\InstrumentationEngine\1.0.19\Instrumentation64\MicrosoftInstrumentationEngine_x64.dll
```

## Solution

The .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) only allows one profiler. If Microsoft's Application Insights profiler is installed on the system, the New Relic profiler will not instrument any applications, and no data will appear. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps).

To resolve this issue, remove or disable Application Insights from your application.

To **remove** the Application Insights Site Extension:

1. Remove the Application Insights Key from **Application** > **Settings** > **Application Settings** and **Save**.
2. Remove the extension from **Application** > **Tools** > **Extensions**. Right-click the extension and **Delete**.
3. Remove the **Tile Add-On** from your **Application Panel** (if present).
4. Restart your application.

To **disable** Application Insights through the Azure Portal: Go to the Application Insights panel under the **Settings**. This may restart your app.

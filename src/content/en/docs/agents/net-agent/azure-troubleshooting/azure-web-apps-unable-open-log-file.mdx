## Problem

You are connecting via FTP to your [Microsoft Azure Web App](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps). You can see a `NewRelic.Profiler.####.log` file in **LogFiles\\NewRelic**, but when you try to access the log file, an error message appears.

## Solution

Restart your web app to release the file and create a new profile log.

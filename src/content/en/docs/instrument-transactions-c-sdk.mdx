BETA

Instrument [transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) using the C SDK so you can monitor any application on Linux that uses a language that can import C libraries. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the [**Transactions** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page) in the New Relic UI.

## Contents

For an index of documentation during the private Beta, see the [C SDK table of contents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/c-agent-table-contents).

## Instrument a transaction

To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it in the New Relic UI, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a [web or non-web transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#types).

1. Add the following code immediately **before** the transaction that you want to monitor:

   For web transactions:

   ```
   newrelic_txn_t *txn;
   /* ... */
   txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, "NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION");
   ```

   For non-web transactions:

   ```
   newrelic_txn_t *txn;
   /* ... */
   txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, "NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION");
   ```
2. Add the following code immediately **after** the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor:

   ```
   newrelic_end_transaction(&txn);
   ```

## Instrument segments and errors

Segments are the functions and calls that make up a transaction. After you instrument transactions, you can:

* [Instrument segments](/docs/instrument-segments-c-agent) of a transaction if you want more data about functions called during that transaction.
* [Instrument errors](/docs/instrument-errors-c-agent) so that you can use the New Relic UI to monitor errors that occur during your transactions.

## For more help

Beta support for the C SDK is being handled through [New Relic's Explorers Hub in a private group](https://discuss.newrelic.com/c/support-products-agents/c-agent-pre-release). If you need access to the support group, contact Jodee Varney (Product Manager) at [jvarney@newrelic.com](mailto:jvarney@newrelic.com). Normal support channels will re-route you to the community or the Product Manager.

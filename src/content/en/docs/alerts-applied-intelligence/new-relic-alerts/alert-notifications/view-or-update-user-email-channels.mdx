Alerts automatically includes the [email addresses](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#email) for all users in the selected account as individual notification channels. If this is a [sub-account](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/creating-sub-accounts), the list shows only the sub-account users, not all the users in the master account.

## View account email channels

To view or search the list of user names and emails: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Notification channels**. In the search field, search for 'user'.

## Add or update user channels

Users can't unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. The account Owner or Admin must remove them from the policy's notification channel.

To add or update account users as notification channels for a policy:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.")**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, click **Policies**, and then choose the policy you want to change.
2. Optional: You can update notification channels for specific users. On the **Notification channels page,** select a user, select any policy subscription already associated with the user as applicable to view policy details.
3. Click **Notification channels**, then follow [standard procedures](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/add-or-remove-policy-channels) to add notification channels.
4. Click **Update policy**.

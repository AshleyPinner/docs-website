You can query your [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) data in several ways:

* The search bar at top of the [distributed tracing UI](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data)
* [NRQL query](#example-nrql-queries)
* [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/query-distributed-trace-data-using-graphql-api)

To learn about trace structure, see [How distributed tracing works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works).

## Example NRQL queries

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also construct complex queries in the search bar at the top of the [distributed tracing UI](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data).
</Callout>

Some example NRQL queries:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="percentile-datastore"
    title="Datastore time percentile for an app"
  >
    ```
    SELECT percentile(duration, 50, 95) FROM Span WHERE category = 'datastore' 
    and appName = 'YOUR_APP_NAME' SINCE 4 hours ago TIMESERIES 1 minute
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="database-query-by-host"
    title="Datastore query time for an app, faceted by host"
  >
    ```
    SELECT average(duration) FROM Span WHERE appName = 'YOUR_APP_NAME' 
    and category = 'datastore' FACET host TIMESERIES 1 minute
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="avg-duration-for-method-by-host"
    title="Average duration for a method of a service, faceted by host"
  >
    ```
    SELECT average(duration) FROM Span WHERE appName = 'YOUR_APP_NAME'
    and name = 'FUNCTION_NAME' FACET host TIMESERIES 1 minute
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="histogram-external-services-by-uri"
    title="Histogram of external services called by a service, faceted by external URI"
  >
    ```
    SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 60) FROM Span WHERE category = 'http'
    and appName = 'YOUR_APP_NAME' FACET `http.url` SINCE 4 hours ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="avg-duration-external-all-apps"
    title="Average duration for external calls across all applications"
  >
    ```
    SELECT average(duration) FROM Span WHERE category = 'http'
    SINCE 4 hours ago FACET `http.url` TIMESERIES 1 minute
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Example NerdGraph queries

You can also use [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/graphql-api/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to query your trace data using the API. For more information, see the [NerdGraph distributed tracing data query examples](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/query-distributed-trace-data-using-graphql-api).

## Can't find data?

Having trouble finding data when querying? See [Troubleshooting: missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-missing-trace-data).

[New Relic infrastructure integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your Amazon S3 data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported.

## Features

[Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable cloud storage.

With New Relic's Amazon S3 integration, data reported includes S3 bucket size, bucket object counts, GET requests, POST requests, and other [metrics](#metrics) and [inventory data](#inventory). S3 data is available in pre-built dashboards and you can also create custom queries and charts in [New Relic One](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/use-integration-data-new-relic-insights). You can also create alert conditions to notify you of changes in S3 data.

## Activate integration

<Callout variant="important">
  [Request and Data Transfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/configure-metrics.html) metrics are premium metrics and paid for separately through AWS. For Cloudwatch pricing information, see Amazon's [S3 enhanced monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html) documentation.
</Callout>

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the Amazon S3 integration:

* New Relic polling intervals:
  * S3 buckets: 1 hour
  * S3 requests: 5 minutes
* Amazon CloudWatch polling intervals:
  * S3 buckets: 24 hours
  * S3 requests: 1 minute

Note that changing the polling interval for this integration will only affect data collection for S3 request metrics.

## Find and use data

To find your integration data, go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com) **> Infrastructure > AWS** and select one of the S3 integration links.

You can [query and explore your data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) using the `DatastoreSample` [event type](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type), with a `provider` value of `S3Bucket`.

For more on how to use your data, see [Understand integration data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data).

## Metric data

This integration collects the following Amazon S3 metrics. For more details about these metrics, see [Amazon's S3 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.html#s3-cloudwatch-metrics).

      </td>

      <td>

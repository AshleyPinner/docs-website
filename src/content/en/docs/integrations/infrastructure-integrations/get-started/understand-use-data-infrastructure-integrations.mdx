With [New Relic infrastructure integrations](/docs/infrastructure/integrations), you can monitor the performance of popular services, including [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list), [Google Cloud Platform](/docs/integrations/google-cloud-platform-integrations/getting-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations), [Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-installation-configuration), [Redis](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/redis-monitoring-integration), [MySQL](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mysql-monitoring-integration-new-relic-infrastructure), and more.

Here are some tips on how to find, understand, and use data reported from infrastructure integrations.

## Explore your infrastructure integration's data

The best way to understand infrastructure integrations's data and see what you can do with it is to enable an integration and [explore the data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) in the New Relic UI.

Some recommendations for exploring:

* View dashboards: You can find your dashboards in New Relic One. For details, see [Integration dashboards](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/infrastructure-integration-dashboards-charts).
* Query data: You can run custom queries and charts of your integration data. For more information, see [Query New Relic data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).
* Create alert conditions: See [Alert conditions](#alerts).
* Learn more about what metrics and inventory data an integration reports: See an integration's documentation: [cloud integrations](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#cloud) and [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations).

## Types of integration data

New Relic infrastructure integrations are separated into two main categories:

* [Cloud integrations](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#cloud): Integrations for cloud platform services, including AWS, Azure, and GCP.
* [On-host integrations](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations#on-host): "On-host" refers to core services integrations that you can install directly on a host. Examples: MySQL, NGINX, Kubernetes, Redis.

An infrastructure integration can generate four types of data:

* **Metrics**: Numeric measurement data. Examples: message counts, error counts, and CPU used percentage. Metric data appears in an integration's charts. For details about what metrics are reported and how to query them, see the documentation for a specific integration. For details about data structure, see [Data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metric-event-attributes).
* **Inventory**: Information about the state and configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data: configuration settings, the name of the host the service is on, the AWS region, the port being used. Inventory data appears in the [**Inventory** UI page](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infra-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure). Inventory data also appears in integration dashboards. Changes to inventory data generates [event data](#event-data).
* **Events**: Events represent important activity on a system. Examples of event data: an admin logging in; a package install or uninstall; a service starting; a table being created. Most events represent changes to inventory data.
* **Attributes**: Some integrations will generate other non-metric attributes (key-value pairs) that can be [queried in New Relic](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

## Create alert conditions

To create an alert condition for integration data in infrastructure, Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Infrastructure**, choose an integration, and then select an available alert option. For more information, see [Infrastructure and alerts](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information).

For [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list), you can also create [alert conditions using NRQL queries](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries). (NRQL alerts are not supported or recommended for cloud integrations, due to issues related to data latency.)

Unless otherwise noted, configuration options for your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with New Relic apply to both Docker and Kubernetes environments. At a minimum, the following configuration values are **required**:

* [License key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key)
* [Cluster name](#definitions-configuration-file)

**Recommendation:** Configure your New Relic license key as an environment variable named `LICENSE_KEY`. This provides a more secure environment, as New Relic can load your environment variable from a [mutual TLS authentication secret](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/add-mutual-tls-prometheus-endpoints).

## Configure nri-prometheus-latest.yaml

The `nri-prometheus-latest.yaml` manifest file includes the `nri-prometheus-cfg` map showing an example configuration. Use the manifest file to configure the following parameters.

    The following is an example configuration file that you can save and modify to fit your needs.

          <td>
            String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped.

            This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label.

            To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as `newrelic/scrape`) and then add the annotation or label `newrelic/scrape: "true"` to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels.

            * To lower memory usage, increase this value.
            * To raise memory usage, decrease this value.

            The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once.

            Default is `30s`. Valid values include `1s`, `15s`, `30s`, `1m`, `5m`, etc.

## Configure objects in target key

If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Key name
      </th>

      <th>

    <tr id="description">

        `description`
      </td>

      <td>
        A description for the URLs in this target.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="urls">
      <td>
        `urls`
      </td>

      <td>
        A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr id="tls-config">
      <td>
        `tls_config`
      </td>

      <td>
        Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about [mutual TLS authentication](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/add-mutual-tls-prometheus-endpoints).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="specify-path-port"
    title="Kubernetes port and endpoint path"
  >
    New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the `prometheus.io/port` and `prometheus.io/path` annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels.

    * If `prometheus.io/port` is not present, the integration will try to scrape each `port` or `ContainerPort` defined for the service.
    * If `prometheus.io/path` is not present, the integration will default to `/metrics`.
    * If a service is not running on the default `/my-metrics-path` path, add a label to the pod `prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path`. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, `foo/bar`), use annotations instead.

    In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port `8080` and in the path `my-metrics.`

    In the `PodSpec` metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels `prometheus.io/port: "8080"` and `prometheus.io/path: "my-metrics"`. When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to `http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics`.

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: my-app
            prometheus.io/scrape: "true" 
            prometheus.io/port: "8080" 
            prometheus.io/path: "my-metrics"
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Reload the configuration

The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration **does not** automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file.

![Docker icon](./images/docker-logo-crop.png "Docker icon") **Docker:**

To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration:

```
docker restart nri-prometheus
```

![img-integration-k8s@2x.png](./images/img-integration-k8s%402x.png "img-integration-k8s@2x.png") **Kubernetes:**

To reload the configuration, restart the integration. **Recommendation:** Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica:

```
kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1
```

## Docker: Run previous config file

![Docker icon](./images/docker-logo-crop.png "Docker icon") **Docker:** To run the integration with the previous configuration file:

1. Copy the content and save it to a `config.yaml` file.
2. From within the same directory, run the command:

   ```
   docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
       --name nri-prometheus \
       -e CLUSTER_NAME="YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME" \
       -e LICENSE_KEY="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" \
       -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml" \
       newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml
   ```

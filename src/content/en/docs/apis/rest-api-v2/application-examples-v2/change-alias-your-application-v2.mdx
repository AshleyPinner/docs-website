The application name you see in the New Relic's user interface is a human-readable [alias](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application#app-alias) for the primary name assigned in your configuration settings. If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc.

By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name.

## Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds

To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's [API Explorer](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) by selecting [**Applications > Update**](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/applications/update).

* You will need to supply the `${APPID}`, `${API_KEY}`, and the alias `name` you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.
* You must also provide `APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD`, `BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD`, and the monitoring enabled `BOOLEAN` (`true` or `false`) even if they are not being modified.

```
curl -X PUT "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json" \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d \
'{
  "application": {
    "name": "name",
    "settings": {
      "app_apdex_threshold": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD,
      "end_user_apdex_threshold": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD,
      "enable_real_user_monitoring": BOOLEAN
    }
  }
}'
```

This is the equivalent of using the [APM UI](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application) to change the displayed app name. This will **not** change the [app identifier name](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application#app-identifier) under which your data will be collected. It will only change the app name that appears in the New Relic user interface.

## Vulnerability information

New Relic's Node.js agent collects the request headers during an error trace to help determine the root cause of problems. The referer header is the URI that identifies the address of the webpage that linked to the resource being requested. It is possible that the referer URI may contain sensitive information in the request query parameters. New Relic has found that the query parameters are not properly stripped during the error trace. This update fixes this by stripping the query parameters from the referer in the request header before sending this data to New Relic.

### Mitigating factors

* Best practices recommend not using query parameters to pass sensitive data.

## Workarounds

New Relic has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

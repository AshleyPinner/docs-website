Legacy

In February 2014, custom dashboards (v2) replaced our original custom dashboards feature (v1). Custom dashboards (v2) are part of a legacy feature and are being retained only for use with our [legacy plugins tool](#eol-plugins). In addition, plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the [EU region data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center).

<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * [**newrelic.com/integrations**](https://newrelic.com/integrations): Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * [**developer.newrelic.com**](https://developer.newrelic.com): Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.

## Limited access to legacy plugins

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

Limited access

<Callout variant="important">
  For an even better experience than plugins, go to:

  * **[newrelic.com/integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations)**: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.
  * **[developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com)**: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.
</Callout>

## Limited access to legacy plugins

As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.

The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832).

## Licenses for developing plugins

In addition to the [Plugins licenses](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-plugins/plugins-licenses) used by New Relic, the software licenses associated with developing plugins depend on the plugin itself. For example:

* Plugins developed with the Java SDK for Plugins use the same MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses as [New Relic APM's Java agent](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-apm/java-agent-licenses).
* Plugins developed with the Ruby SDK for Plugins use the same MIT licenses as [New Relic APM's Ruby agent](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-apm/ruby-agent-licenses).
* Plugins developed with the .NET SDK for New Relic Plugins use the same MIT licenses as [New Relic APM's .NET agent](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-apm/net-agent-licenses).
* Collectors for Plugins use the same MySQL Java licenses as New Relic. For more information, see [Data collector licenses](/docs/licenses/license-information/special-services-licenses/data-collector-licenses).

Plugins that do not use an SDK fall under the licensing agreements that the individual plugin author uses.

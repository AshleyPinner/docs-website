**[rpm.newrelic.com/apm](https://rpm.newrelic.com/apm) > (select an app) > Events > Alerts**: Use this page to view or filter information about alerts over the past two weeks.

The **Alerts** page shows a list of alerts over the past two weeks, if any. Use any of New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/new-relic-user-interface) and [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information.

Each alert notification includes the alert icon and summary information. To view details about an alert notification on the Alerts page, select its link. For example:

* To view details about a specific alert, select its name.
* To narrow the list of alerts, use the **Filter**.
* To view all alerts for all of your apps and hosts, select the **All alerts** link.
* To select a specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM) if applicable, select your choice from the **JVMs** menu.

## Alerts across apps and hosts

To view history about Critical alerts and outages across all of your applications and hosts:

1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/apm](https://rpm.newrelic.com/apm) > Alerts > Alert history**.
2. Optional: Select **Show alerts for hidden applications**.

The list separates alerts into categories, including:

* In progress
* Today
* Yesterday
* This week
* Prior to last week

From here you can filter and select select specific incidents.

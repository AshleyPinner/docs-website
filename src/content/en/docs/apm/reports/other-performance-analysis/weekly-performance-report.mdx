Every Monday, New Relic sends a weekly performance report via email to any of your account's users who have [selected to receive this report](/docs/subscriptions/account-email-settings). The email report contains summary performance metrics for the past week for a select group of your applications. The weekly performance report is different than APM's [Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports](/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports).

<Callout variant="important">
  At this time, weekly performance reports are not available for accounts in the EU region.
</Callout>

## View example report details

To see an example of a weekly performance report for your account:

1. From the New Relic UI's [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User preferences**.
2. From **Weekly summaries**, select **See a sample email**.

The performance report is split into sections:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Section**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Featured app
      </td>

      <td>
        This provides both [throughput pattern and performance metrics](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page#overview_charts) for the application with the highest call count in your account.

        Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that don't, even if the call count is lower.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        All apps report
      </td>

      <td>
        This section provides important performance metrics for the 20 applications in your account with the highest call count. Metrics in this list include uptime, [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction), load time, and throughput.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Recent events
      </td>

      <td>
        This section contains any recent alerts, deployments you have made to your app, or other events that are recorded for applications in your account.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Selected applications

New Relic selects the top 20 apps by call count that meet these criteria:

* The app must have at least 25 requests per minute (rpm) throughput.
* The app must include web transactions.

Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that don't, even if the call count is lower.

## Opt in or out of report emails

To stop receiving weekly performance reports:

1. From the New Relic UI's [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User preferences**.
2. From **Weekly Summaries**, clear the **Weekly report** checkbox.
3. From **Weekly Summaries**, select **Save email preferences**.

To resume receiving weekly reports, select the **Weekly report** checkbox.

## Analyze your data

APM includes several reports in the user interface. To gather, analyze, and visualize data about your software in other formats, use [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).

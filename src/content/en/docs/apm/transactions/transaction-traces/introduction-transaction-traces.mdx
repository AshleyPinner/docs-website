In [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm), a **transaction trace** gives a detailed snapshot of a single [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working.

## What transactions record traces

In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm). Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and [troubleshoot performance issues](#troubleshoot-example).

Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces:

* Over the minute-long [harvest cycle](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#harvest-cycle), all transactions that violate the threshold (either four times your [Apdex T value](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions.
* At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it.

These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example:

* The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions.
* If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling.

If you [don't see traces in your account](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/troubleshooting-not-seeing-transaction-traces), it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust [transaction trace settings](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces) to ensure some transactions will be traced.

If you use [Synthetic](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics), you will likely have [Synthetic monitor traces](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collect-synthetic-transaction-traces). Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute.

## Configure transaction traces

To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for:

* [Transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces)
* [Key transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces#key-txns)

## View transaction traces in UI

To view transaction traces:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Entity explorer: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Entity explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
   * APM: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
2. In the **Transaction traces** section, click transaction traces to view [additional details](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-summary-page).

## Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces

If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/troubleshooting-not-seeing-transaction-traces).

For more information about using transaction traces, slow queries, and service maps to solve performance issues, see [Analyze performance issues](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues).

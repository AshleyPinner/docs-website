In APM, every [key transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events) has its own **Overview** page and several other UI pages. Depending on the [type of transaction (web or non-web)](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm), different information appears.

## Overview page

When you select a transaction from the [key transaction index](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events#find), the key transaction's **Overview** page appears. The **Overview** page contains charts for response time, [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction), throughput, and other data. It is similar to the [main Overview page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) in New Relic APM, with [standard New Relic page functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions).

## SLA report page

The **SLA report** page for a key transaction displays [Service Level Agreement](/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports-dashboard) reports for that transaction. The SLA reports include daily and weekly data about throughput, response time, and Apdex. You can also download the report as a comma-separated value (CSV) spreadsheet.

## Alerts

When you select a transaction from the [key transaction index](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events#find), you can also see options to view [alert condition violations and set alert policies](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/view-key-transactions-alert-information).

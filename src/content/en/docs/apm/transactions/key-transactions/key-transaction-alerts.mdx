In APM, you can create alert policies for your [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events) with [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts).

## Create an alert condition for a key transaction

To create an alert condition for a key transaction:

1. Follow the steps to [create an alert condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#create-condition) for an APM-monitored entity.
2. Select **Key transaction metric** as the type of condition.

## View key transaction alert status

To view the current health status of key transactions:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Key transactions**.
2. View the transactions' [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies).
3. For more details, hover over the health status.

For more on how to create alert policies and conditions, see [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts).

## Problem

Charts in the New Relic UI are missing or not displaying correctly.

## Solution

Browser extensions that modify JavaScript, such as Adblock, Ghostery, or Request Maker, can cause display issues. To fix this issue, add our New Relic domains to your allow list, or uninstall the extension.

Also, your browser might be too old to display New Relic charts. Verify your browser meets our minimum [supported browser versions](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/supported-browsers).

In [New Relic Insights](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights), the **Data explorer** UI page lets you explore the data available to you.

<Callout variant="important">
  There are two data explorer tabs available: **Events** and **Metrics**. This document explains details about **Events**. For information on the **Metrics** tab, see [Metrics data explorer](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/metric-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents).
</Callout>

## Events vs metrics

In New Relic Insights, the **Data explorer** page has two tabs:

* **Events:** In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to any data that can be queried via [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query). This includes all our major [data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types), including [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) and the [Metric](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#dimensional-metrics), [Log](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#log-data), and [Span](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#trace-data) data types.
* **Metrics:** In the context of the Insights UI, this refers to [metric timeslice data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#timeslice-data). (Note that metric timeslice data is available for [querying with NRQL in New Relic One](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql).)

<Callout variant="tip">
  For an improved querying and charting experience, we recommend using [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one) chart builder and dashboards.

**[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Data explorer > Events**: Use the **Events** tab to explore your [available data](#events-metrics).

## UI components

Use the **Events** data explorer to view and explore the [data available to you](#events-metrics). The UI includes:

* A dropdown that lets you select a data type, like `PageView` or `Transaction`.
* A time-based chart for that data.
* A sample of that data type, showing its attached attributes, and the ability to see other samples.
* Ability to search by group by and search for specific attributes.

## Data samples

The most recent sample for the chosen data type is listed at the bottom of the page. [Default attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes) are underlined.

To see more samples, select **See more samples**. Note that you may need to scroll left and right to see the full table of data.

**[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Data explorer > Events**: Select **See more samples** to see a listing of recent samples.

<Callout variant="caution">
  The amount of data stored for a given event type can run into the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of records. This report only shows a small sample. Use this UI to review the **structure** of the data, not the contents of a specific record. For example, you can use it to make sure an attribute is populating properly.

Insights has three levels of permissions for your dashboards, controlling how visible and editable they are.

## Permission levels

The dashboard permissions are:

* **Private to just me**: If you created the dashboard, you're the only one who can view and edit it. This is the most secure option.
* **Visible to others in my account**: Everyone can view the dashboard, but only you can edit it.
* **Editable by others in my account** (default): Everyone can edit the dashboard. This includes deleting it.

This table describes user roles as they relate to dashboard permissions.

## Set the dashboard permission level

To set the permission level for a dashboard, make sure that you're looking at a specific dashboard, and then click **Edit**. Select the new permission level, followed by **Done editing**.

Using [NRQL](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference), you can create [NRQL charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/widgets-present-insights-data-different-formats) to visualize your data in billboards, pie charts, histograms, and other formats. NRQL charts have some different display and customization options than [metric charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/add-customize-metric-widgets).

## Add NRQL charts to dashboard

Whenever you run a [NRQL query](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference), you can add charts for that query to a dashboard.

* To add the resulting chart to the current dashboard, select **Add to this dashboard**.
* To add the chart to another dashboard, select **Add to** and select the target dashboard from the list.

## Customize NRQL charts

To edit a chart select **Edit chart** from the chart menu <Icon name="more-horizontal"/>
.

Customization options include:

* Change the underlying [NRQL query](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference) to change things like the time window, returned data, the type of chart, etc.
* Change or add the title
* Add notes to a chart in the **Notes** field to remind yourself of what data a widget displays, or to share information with teammates
* Link to another dashboard
* Copy to another dashboard
* Expand the chart
* [Embed it in a web page](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/using-widgets#embed)

Each instance of a chart is unique. Editing a chart will not affect any other copies of that chart, in the same dashboard or in a different dashboard.

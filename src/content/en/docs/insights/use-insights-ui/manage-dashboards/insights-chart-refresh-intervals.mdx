The refresh rate of UI charts is the range of the query's timeframe divided by 60. The maximum frequency with which queries can be refreshed is every 5 seconds. This applies to [Insights](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights), [dashboards in New Relic One](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), and [chart builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).

## Examples

For example:

* A query with a 7-day time range would have a refresh rate of once every 2.8 hours.
* A query with a 1-hour time range would have a refresh rate of once every 1 minute.

For `TIMESERIES` queries, the widget uses the size of the `TIMESERIES` bucket as the refresh interval.

For example:

* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 5 minutes` would refresh every 5 minutes.
* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 hour SINCE 1 day ago` would refresh every hour.

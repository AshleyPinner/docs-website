New Relic products report [a variety of default event data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data) to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes.

## Overview of reporting custom events and attributes

Event data is one of the [fundamental New Relic data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types). Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized [queries and charts of your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data), and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you.

Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals.

Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data:

* Ensure you follow [limits and requirements](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/data-requirements) around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size.
* The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your [data retention policy](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/insights-data-retention).

## Send custom events and attributes

Methods for sending custom events and attributes include:

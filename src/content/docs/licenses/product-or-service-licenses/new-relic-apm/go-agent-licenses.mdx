We love open-source software, and use the following in the New Relic Go agent. Thank you, open-source community, for making these fine tools! Some of these are listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={325}>
        **Library**
      </th>

      <th>
        **License**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Go](https://golang.org/)
      </td>

      <td>
        [Go BSD](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/LICENSE)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

The remainder of the code is covered by the [New Relic agent license agreement](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/other-licenses/new-relic-agent-license).

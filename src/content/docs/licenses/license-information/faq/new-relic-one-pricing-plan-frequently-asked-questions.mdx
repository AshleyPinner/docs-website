    title="Q: If I am an existing customer under the product-based pricing plan, I purchased extended retention, and I move to New Relic One-based pricing, will I lose my extended retention benefits?"

    **A:** Unless otherwise stated in an Order, Customers that previously purchased extended retention for their products under the product-based pricing plan (i.e., New Relic Insights Pro and/or New Relic Logs) have access to that same level of extended retention under New Relic One-based pricing for its initial New Relic One term at no additional cost.

    Customers that did not previously purchase extended retention for their products under the original, product-based pricing plan have the default retention per the Documentation and may purchase extended retention.

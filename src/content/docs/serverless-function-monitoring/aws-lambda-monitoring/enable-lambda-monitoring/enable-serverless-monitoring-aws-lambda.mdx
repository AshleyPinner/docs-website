<Callout variant="tip">
  The preferred way of enabling AWS Lambda monitoring with New Relic is via our Lambda layer. For more information, see [Enable serverless monitoring using the Lambda layer](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-using-lambda-layer).
</Callout>

[Serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda](/docs/introduction-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda) offers in-depth performance monitoring for your Lambda functions. Read on to learn how to enable this feature and get started using it.

## How Lambda monitoring works

Before enabling Lambda monitoring, understanding how data flows from your Lambda functions to New Relic may be helpful:

![New Relic monitoring for AWS Lambda architecture - diagram](./images/new-relic-lambda-monitoring-architecture.png "new-relic-lambda-monitoring-architecture.png")

Diagram showing how data flows from a Lambda function to New Relic.

When our Lambda monitoring is enabled, this is how data moves from your Lambda function to New Relic:

1. The **Lambda function** is instrumented with our code.
2. **CloudWatch** collects Lambda log data and sends it to our log-ingestion Lambda.
3. The **`log-ingestion` Lambda** sends that data to New Relic.

## Enable procedure overview

If you already have a New Relic account and use Node.js or Python, we recommend you use our [automated installer](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/lambda-nerdlets.launcher-lambda-onboarding?launcher=eyJ0aW1lUmFuZ2UiOnsiYmVnaW5fdGltZSI6bnVsbCwiZW5kX3RpbWUiOm51bGwsImR1cmF0aW9uIjoxODAwMDAwfSwiJGlzRmFsbGJhY2tUaW1lUmFuZ2UiOnRydWV9&pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJsYW1iZGEtbmVyZGxldHMubGFtYmRhLW9uYm9hcmRpbmctY29ubmVjdGVkLWFjY291bnRzIn0=&cards%5B0%5D=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJsYW1iZGEtbmVyZGxldHMubGFtYmRhLW9uYm9hcmRpbmctaW5zdHJ1Y3Rpb25zIn0=).

<Callout variant="tip">
  Using this feature may result in AWS charges. See [Lambda monitoring requirements](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/compatibility-requirements-aws-lambda-monitoring).
</Callout>

If you do **not** use the automated installer, complete these steps to set up monitoring:

1. [Install our CLI tool](#cli) (recommended)
2. [Connect AWS and New Relic](#connect-aws) (required)
3. [Enable instrumentation of your Lambda](#instrument-lambda) (required)
4. [Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic](#stream-logs) (required)

## Step 1. Install the `newrelic-lambda-cli` tool

We provide a command line interface (CLI) tool that's used in steps 2 through 4. We recommend the CLI because it simplifies some of the work, but you can also perform those steps manually.

If you want to understand what it does before you install it, see the manual procedures that the CLI tool performs in [Step 2](#connect-aws), Step 3 ([option 2](#cli-layer)), and [Step 4](#stream-logs). You can also see the [CLI documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli). If you prefer a manual install, skip to [Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic](#connect-aws).

### CLI requirements

To use the CLI too, you need:

* Python 3.3 or higher
* The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* You must be a user or [admin](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/users-roles#roles) with an infrastructure manager [Add-on role](/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-roles-permissions).
* Your AWS account needs permissions for creating IAM resources (Role and Policy) and Lambda functions. These resources are created using CloudFormation stacks, so you'll need permissions to create those. For more on permissions, including setting custom policies, expand this collapser:

  <CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
      id="aws-permissions"
      title="AWS permissions details"
    >
      ```
      Resource: *
      Actions:
          "cloudformation:CreateChangeSet",
          "cloudformation:CreateStack",
          "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
          "cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSets",
          "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
          "iam:CreateRole",
          "iam:GetRole",
          "iam:PassRole",
          "lambda:AddPermission",
          "lambda:CreateFunction",
          "lambda:GetFunction",
          "logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter",
          "logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters",
          "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter"
         "s3:GetObject"
          "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet"

      Resource: "arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion"
      Actions:
          "serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate"
          "serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate"
      ```

      <Callout variant="caution">
        Be sure that the AWS account you use to execute the CLI has all of these permissions.
      </Callout>

      If your AWS account permissions are restrictive and you're unable to use the CLI, you can optionally use a manually managed custom IAM policy. This policy would require, at minimum, the following permissions:

      ```
      Resource: "*"
      Action:      
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
        "lambda:GetAccountSettings"
        "lambda:ListFunctions"
        "lambda:ListAliases"
        "lambda:ListTags"
        "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings"
      ```

      These permissions are the minimum required. We recommend granting a managed `ReadOnlyAccess` policy as described in [Connect AWS to infrastructure monitoring](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure#connect).
    </Collapser>
  </CollapserGroup>

### CLI installation

To install the CLI tool:

1. Ensure you have the [required permissions for both your New Relic and AWS account](#cli).
2. From the command line, run:

   ```
   pip install newrelic-lambda-cli
   ```

<Callout variant="important">
  You may need to use `pip3` in the command above if you have Python 2.7 installed. The CLI requires Python >=3.3.
</Callout>

## Step 2. Connect AWS to New Relic

<Callout variant="important">
  You must complete this step, and steps 3 and 4, to enable our Lambda monitoring.
</Callout>

This step connects AWS to New Relic and creates a `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function that sends your instrumented data to New Relic. You can either use the CLI tool or do the steps manually.

### Use CLI tool

When you use the CLI, you have one optional step and one required step:

1. Optional: If you're using multiple AWS profiles or multiple regions, you may want to configure the AWS environment variables:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="aws-env-variables"
       title="AWS environment variable instructions"
     >
       **Setting the region**  
       To configure your region, use this [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) to override the default region:

       ```
       export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=MY_REGION # us-west-2, for example
       ```

       The CLI tool also allows passing this per-command using `--aws-region`.

       **Setting profiles**

       If you have multiple AWS profiles and don't want to use the default, use `AWS_PROFILE` [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) to set another profile name. Ensure the profile is properly configured (including the default region). Example:

       ```
       export AWS_PROFILE=MY_PROFILE
       ```
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
2. Run the following command using the [CLI tool](#cli):

   ```
   newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \
   --linked-account-name YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME \
   --nr-api-key YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY
   ```

   This command:

   * Connects your AWS account to New Relic.
   * Installs a `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda that will send your instrumented data to New Relic.

   More details:

   * This defaults to U.S. region. If your account is in the [EU region](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center), add this argument: `--nr-region "eu"`. If you're instrumenting functions in multiple AWS regions, this command must be run for each region using the `--aws-region` argument.
   * YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME is either a new AWS account you want to link to New Relic, or it's the name of the AWS account that you linked to when setting up the AWS Lambda monitoring integration.
   * YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY refers to your [user key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key) (not your REST API key).
   * For more on the API key and other arguments, see our [Lambda monitoring GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#install-integration).

### Manual procedures

Here are the manual procedures performed by the [CLI tool](#cli):

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="manual-connect"
    title="Connect AWS to New Relic"
  >
    The `newrelic-lambda integration` command connects the AWS account containing your Lambdas to New Relic. If you've already installed one of our [AWS integrations](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list), your accounts should be linked to New Relic and you can skip this section.

    To manually establish this connection, follow the instructions for [connecting AWS to Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure#connect).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-nr-lambda"
    title="Configure our log-ingestion Lambda"
  >
    The `newrelic-lambda integration` command sets up a `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda. This Lambda takes the logs generated by your Lambda functions and pushes those logs to New Relic. If you're configuring this manually, you must configure our Lambda for the regions you want.

    The CLI, by default, establishes our Lambda in all regions.

    To manually configure our Lambda, go to the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/ "Link opens in a new window."), which is where the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda is stored. This repo is a collection of serverless applications published by developers, companies, and partners in the serverless community. It allows developers to share their Lambda functions code with customers, who can then find and deploy the corresponding application Lambda function. Each application is packaged with an AWS [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model "Link opens in a new window.") (SAM) template that defines the AWS resources used.

    To manually configure our Lambda with the AWS Serverless Application Repository:

    1. From the AWS console, go to the Lambda section, select **Create function**, and select **Serverless Application Repository**.
    2. Search for `newrelic` and find the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda. Follow the instructions in the [Lambda's documentation](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications%7ENewRelic-log-ingestion "Link opens in a new window.") to deploy it. A [SAM template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-template-basics.html "Link opens in a new window.") will build the Lambda.
    3. In the [environment variable section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html) in AWS console, set the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable to your [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). Note: If you have multiple accounts or a master and sub-account hierarchy, make sure the license key you're using matches the same account connected to AWS.
    4. Optional: If you want to stream all your logs to New Relic, set the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`. For more on this, see [Stream all logs](#stream-logs).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Step 3. Enable Lambda instrumentation

This step enables instrumentation of your Lambda function, which allows detailed monitoring and alerting functionality. Our instrumentation is designed to have minimal impact on your Lambda performance.

If you're using Node.js or Python, we recommend the first two options.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="serverless-plugin"
    title="Option #1: Use Serverless Framework plugin (Node.js and Python)"
  >
    **Requirements**

    * Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see [Manual instrumentation](#manual-instrument).
    * [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/) version 1.34.0 or higher.

    **Features**

    If you meet the requirements (above), you can use our Serverless Framework plugin, which allows you to add our AWS Lambda Layer to your functions without requiring a code change.

    * Supports Node.js and Python runtimes
    * No code change required to enable Lambda instrumentation
    * Enables our APM agent functionality using a single layer
    * Configures CloudWatch subscription filters automatically
    * Gets the layer into your code base which is useful for redeploys

    **Install**

    To install our Serverless Framework plugin:

    1. Choose an install option:
       * NPM:

         ```
         npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
         ```
       * yarn:

         ```
         yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
         ```
    2. Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

       ```
       plugins:
         - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers
       ```
    3. Get your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) and put it in the `serverless.yml`:

       ```
       custom:
         newRelic:
             accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
       ```
    4. Deploy it:

       ```
       sls deploy
       ```

    You can skip [Step 4. Setting up CloudWatch Logs](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/enable-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda#stream-logs). This is automatically completed on deploy by our Serverless Framework plugin.

    For the next step, go to [What's next?](#find-data)

  <Collapser
    id="cli-layer"
    title="Option #2: Add Lambda Layer with our CLI (Node.js and Python)"
  >
    <Callout variant="important">
      Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see [Manual instrumentation](#manual-instrument).
    </Callout>

    If you don’t have [Serverless Framework](#serverless-plugin) and don't intend to redeploy your function frequently, you can use the CLI to add our Lambda Layer:

    1. If you haven't already done so, install the CLI:

       ```
       pip install newrelic-lambda-cli
       ```
    2. List available functions:

       ```
       newrelic-lambda functions list
       ```

       Pass the option `-f not-installed` to see which functions have not yet been instrumented.
    3. Add the layer to your function:

       ```
       newrelic-lambda layers install --function FUNCTION_NAME --nr-account-id NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID
       ```

    Next, you will [configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-layer"
    title="Option #3: Manually add our Lambda Layer (Node.js and Python)"
  >
    <Callout variant="important">
      Available only for Node.js and Python. For other languages, see [Manual instrumentation](#manual-instrument).
    </Callout>

    If you don’t have [Serverless Framework](#serverless-plugin), you can manually add our Lambda Layer:

    1. Find the [layer](https://nr-layers.iopipe.com/) that matches your runtime and region.
    2. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function.
    3. Update your functions handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function:
       * Python: `newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler`
       * Node: `newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler`
    4. Add these environment variables to your Lambda console:
       * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id)
       * `NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER`: Path to your initial handler.

    If you have Node 8 and get a `Lambda can't find file` error message, expand this collapser:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="node-8-error"
        title="Node 8 &quot;can't find file&quot; error troubleshooting"
      >
        If you have Node 8 and receive a `Lambda can't find the file newrelic-lambda-wrapper.js` message, it's likely that the Node runtime isn't resolving `NPM_PATH` for the `newrelic-lambda` module in `/opt/nodejs/node_modules`. These steps should fix this problem:

        * Create a `newrelic-wrapper-helper.js` script in your project's root.
        * The script's contents should be `module.exports = require('newrelic-lambda-wrapper');`. (That is all that needs to be in that script.)
        * Update the handler for your layer declaration to `newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler`.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    Next, you will [configure CloudWatch to send logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-instrument"
    title="Option #4: Manually instrument Lambda code for Go, Java, .NET Core, Node.js, and Python"
  >
    If none of the [previous options](#instrument-lambda) work for you, you can manually instrument your Lambda code. Choose your language:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="go"
        title="Go"
      >
        To instrument your Go-language Lambda:

        1. Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function.
        2. Install the agent: `go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent`.
        3. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our [GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/_integrations/nrlambda/example/main.go).
        4. Optional: Add [custom events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#custom-event) that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the [`RecordCustomEvent` API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/go-agent/features/create-custom-events-insights-go). For example:

           ```
           func handler(ctx context.Context) {
           	if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn {
           		txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent("MyEvent", map[string]interface{}{
           			"zip": "zap",
           		})
           	}
           	fmt.Println("hello world!")
           }
           ```
        5. Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS.

           <CollapserGroup>
             <Collapser
               id="zip-upload"
               title="Zip and upload recommendations"
             >
               Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda:

               1. Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called `main`. You can use:

                  ```
                  $ GOOS=linux go build -o main
                  ```
               2. Zip the binary into a deployment package using:

                  ```
                  $ zip deployment.zip main
                  ```
               3. Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler `main` (to match the name given during the binary build).
             </Collapser>
           </CollapserGroup>
        6. The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), set these [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html) in the AWS console:
           * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`. Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
           * `NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY.` This is also your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account.
        7. Optional: To configure logging, see [Go agent logging](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-logging).
        8. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work.

        Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll [configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="java"
        title="Java"
      >
        Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our [APM Java agent](/docs/agents/java-agent). Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies:

        * AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: [OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing) instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler.
        * Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support.

        <Callout variant="tip">
          **Supported OpenTracing Versions**

          * **OpenTracing 0.31.0**:
            * Lambda Tracer: [com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.newrelic.opentracing/newrelic-java-lambda/1.1.1/jar)
            * Lambda SDK: [com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.newrelic.opentracing/java-aws-lambda/1.0.0/jar)
          * **OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0**:
            * Lambda Tracer: [com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.newrelic.opentracing/newrelic-java-lambda)
            * Lambda SDK: [com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.newrelic.opentracing/java-aws-lambda)
        </Callout>

        To instrument your Java Lambda:

        1. In your project’s `build.gradle` file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies:

           ```
           dependencies {
                  compile("com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0")
                  compile("com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1")
                  compile("io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0")
           }
           ```
        2. Implement the AWS Lambda `RequestHandler` interface as shown in the [Java Lambda example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-tracer-java#usage) and override the `doHandleRequest` method.
        3. In the `doHandleRequest` method, call the `LambdaTracing.instrument(...)` API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function.
        4. Register a `LambdaTracer.INSTANCE` as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the [Java Lambda example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-tracer-java#usage).
        5. [Create a ZIP deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-package.html) and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means.
        6. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the [example Java Lambda](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-tracer-java#usage), the handler would be `com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest`. Because `handleRequest` is assumed, you could also use `com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler`.
        7. The following [AWS console environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html) are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing). This is recommended.
           * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`. Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
           * `NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID`. This is also your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
           * `NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY`. This is also your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account.
        8. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_DEBUG` is `true`.
        9. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work.

        Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll [configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).

        Please see the [AWS Lambda distributed tracing example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-tracer-java/tree/main/examples/distributed-tracing-example) for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as:

        * Distributed tracing between Lambda functions
        * Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation)
        * Tracing external calls
        * Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans

      <Collapser
        id="net-core"
        title=".NET Core"
      >
        Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard [.NET Core APM agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/compatibility-requirements-net-core-agent). Instead, it uses a NuGet package.

        To instrument your .NET Core Lambda:

        1. In your Lambda Functions project, install the `NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer` NuGet package.

           Note: `NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer` depends on version 1.2.0+ of `Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent` NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of `Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent`, the New Relic package may produce errors such as `System.MissingMethodException` .
        2. Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils:

           ```
           using OpenTracing.Util;
           using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda;
           ```
        3. Instrument your function, as shown in this example:

           ```
           public class Function
           {

             static Function()
             {
               // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance
               GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance);
             }

             public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context)
             {
               // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as 
               // an argument
               return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context);
             }

             /// <summary>
             /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper
             /// </summary>
             /// <param name="input"></param>
             /// <param name="context"></param>
             /// <returns></returns>
             public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context)
             { ... }

           }
           ```

           <Callout variant="tip">
             The arguments passed to `FunctionWrapper` must match the signature of `FunctionHandler`.
           </Callout>

           If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the `APIGatewayProxyFunction`.

           For an example, see below:

                 Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(
                                                  ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext);
                 return task;

                   OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance);
                 }

                 public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext)
                 {
                   Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext);
                   return task;
                 }

                 public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext)
                 {
                   return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext);
                 }
               }

           </CollapserGroup>
        4. Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one.

           <Callout variant="important">
             Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them.
           </Callout>

           1. Set the `NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER` environment variable to `true`.
           2. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers.

              <CollapserGroup>

                  id="net-dt-sqs"
                  title="Using the SQS Wrapper"
                >
                  The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods:

                  * Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...)
                  * Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...)

                  Examples

                  ```
                  // SQS Client
                  AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", AWS_REGION);


                  // SendMessageRequest
                  SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest("QUEUE_URI_STRING", "An SQS Message");
                  Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest);


                  // String-based
                  Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, "QUEUE_URI_STRING", "Another SQS Message");


                  // SendMessageBatchRequest
                  List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>();
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id1", "First SQS Message"));
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id2", "Second SQS Message"));
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id3", "Third SQS Message"));
                  SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries);
                  Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest);

                  List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>();
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id4", "Fourth SQS Message"));
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id5", "Fifth SQS Message"));
                  batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry("id6", "Sixth SQS Message"));
                  Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries);
                  ```

                >
                  The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods:

                  * Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...)

                  Examples

                  ```
                  // SNS Client
                  AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", AWS_REGION);

                  Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest);


                  // PublishRequest - ARN
                  PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest("TOPIC_ARN", "An SNS Message");
                  Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest);

              </CollapserGroup>
        5. The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), set these environment variables in the [AWS Lambda console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html):
           * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`: The [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) the Lambda is reporting to.
           * `NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY`: This is also the [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account.
        6. Ensure that the wrapper function (`FunctionWrapper` in above example) is set up as the function handler.
        7. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work.

        Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll [configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="node"
        title="Node.js"
      >
        To instrument your Node.js Lambda:

        1. Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the `node_modules` directory. Use the Node Package Manager:

           ```
           npm install newrelic --save
           ```
        2. Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent:

           ```
           npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save
           ```
        3. In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example:

           ```
           const newrelic = require('newrelic');
           require('@newrelic/aws-sdk');

           <Other module loads go under the two require statements above>

           module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => {
             // This is your handler function code
             console.log('Lambda executed');
             callback();
           });
           ```
        4. Optional: You can also add [custom events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#custom-event) to your Lambda using the [`recordCustomEvent` API](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/nodejs-agent-api#record_custom_event). For example:

           ```
           module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => {
             newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); 

             console.log('Lambda executed');
             callback();
           });
           ```
        5. Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations:

           * The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included.
           * If your Lambda function file name is, for example, `lambda_function.node`, we recommend naming your zip file `lambda_function.zip`. Do not use a tarball.
           * Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work.
        6. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account.
        7. In the AWS console, set these [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html):

           * `NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE`. Set to `true` if not using a configuration file.
           * `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`: Your application name.
           * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`. Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
           * `NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY`. This is also your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account.
        8. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED` to `true`. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. **Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS**.)
        9. Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables:
           * Set `NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED` to `true`.
           * Set `NEW_RELIC_LOG` to `stdout` for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location.
           * The log level is set to `info` by default. See [other log levels](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#logging_config).
        10. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work.

        Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll [configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).

      <Collapser
        id="python"
        title="Python"
      >
        To instrument your Python Lambda:

        1. Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip:

           ```
           pip install -t . newrelic
           ```

           <Callout variant="important">
             If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: `DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both`. For details, see the [Homebrew GitHub post](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Homebrew-and-Python.md#note-on-pip-install---user).
           </Callout>
        2. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. **The New Relic package must be imported first in your code.** Here's an example:

           ```
           import newrelic.agent
           newrelic.agent.initialize()

           @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler()
           def handler(event, context):
           ...
           ```
        3. Optional: You can also add [custom events](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#custom-event) to your Lambda using the [`record_custom_event` API](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/record_custom_event). Here's an example:

           ```
           @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler()
           def handler(event, context):
               newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'})
           …
           ```
        4. Zip your `lambda_function.py` and `newrelic/` folder together using these guidelines:

           * The New Relic files outside the `newrelic/` folder don't need to be included.
           * If your Lambda function file name is, for example, `lambda_function.py`, name your zip file `lambda_function.zip`. Do not use a tarball.
           * Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work.
        5. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account.
        6. In the AWS console, set this [environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html):

           * `NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED`. Set to `true`
        7. The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), set these [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html) in the AWS console:
           * `NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED`. Set to true.
           * `NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID`. Your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id).
           * `NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY.` This is also your [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account.
        8. Optional: To configure logging, use the [`NEW_RELIC_LOG` and `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL` environment variables](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#environment-variables) in the AWS Console.
        9. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work.

        The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, [configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic](#stream-logs).

    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Step 4. Configure CloudWatch logs to stream to New Relic Lambda

In this step, you'll link your Lambda function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda that was configured in [Step 2](#connect-aws).

<Callout variant="important">
  For Node.js and Python: This step isn't necessary if you used the [Serverless Framework plugin option in Step 3](#serverless-plugin).
</Callout>

This step can be done using the CLI tool or using manual procedures.

### Use CLI tool

Run this command for every Lambda function you want to monitor:

```
newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function FUNCTION_NAME_#1
```

Or to set subscription filters for all supported functions run this command::

```
newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function all
```

Notes on this command:

* You should only need one `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda per AWS account and region. You can subscribe as many functions to it as you like.
* To see more detail about the arguments, including a region-specifying argument, see our [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#install-log-subscription).
* You may receive a CloudWatch validation error. This doesn't affect data reporting. If you see data reporting in New Relic, disregard that error message.

<Callout variant="important">
  If you have our [Logs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs) and want to send all your log data to us (not just Lambda logs), see [Stream all logs](#stream-all-logs).
</Callout>

### Manual procedures

Here are the manual procedures performed by the [CLI tool](#cli):

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="manual-stream-logs"
    title="Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda"
  >
    In [Step 2](#connect-aws), you set up a `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function. After you've instrumented your Lambda function ([Step 3](#instrument-lambda)), the `newrelic-lambda subscriptions` command links that function's CloudWatch Logs stream to the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda. To do this manually:

    1. Open CloudWatch and select **Logs** in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring.
    2. Select **Actions** and choose **Stream to AWS Lambda**.
    3. Under **Lambda function**, select the `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
    4. Set the **Log format** to `JSON`.
    5. Set the **Subscription filter pattern to** `?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?"Task timed out" ?RequestId`. Alternatively, if you are using the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable [stream all your logs](#stream-all-logs) to our Logs, leave this field blank.

    See [notes and caveats about this procedure](#stream-logs).

    <Callout variant="important">
      Make sure the `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## What's next?

After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next:

* See data reporting in the [Lambda monitoring UI](/docs/lambda-monitoring-ui). If you're having trouble finding your data, see [Lambda enable troubleshooting](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-enabling-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda).
* Use [configuration settings](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/configure-monitoring-aws-lambda-new-relic-serverless) to fine-tune your data.

<Callout variant="important">
  **Our `newrelic-log-ingestion` function is not updated automatically.** For best results and access to latest features, we recommend you occasionally [update our Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/update-lambda-monitoring).
</Callout>

## Optional: Stream all logs to New Relic

If you have [log management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/get-started/introduction-new-relic-logs) enabled and want to report **all** your logs to New Relic, follow these instructions:

1. Go to our `newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda and set the `LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.
2. It isn't possible to edit existing filter patterns, so they must be removed and re-added:
   1. Set the **Subscription filter pattern** to `""`. Go to the **Log group** for each monitored Lambda, and remove the `newrelic-log-ingestion` subscription.
   2. [Add the subscription filter back](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/enable-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda#manual-stream-logs), leaving the **Subscription filter pattern** field blank.

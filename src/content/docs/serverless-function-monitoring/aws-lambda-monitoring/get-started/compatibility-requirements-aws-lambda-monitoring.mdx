Before [enabling serverless monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring) for AWS Lambda, make sure you meet the [requirements](#languages) and learn about [AWS charges](#costs) resulting from its use.

## Supported languages

Our Lambda monitoring supports the following languages and [APM agent](/docs/agents) versions:

* Go: 2.7.0
* Java: N/A, doesn't use agent
* .NET Core: N/A, doesn't use agent
* Node.js: 5.6.4
* Python: 4.6.0.106

For complete Lambda instrumentation, you must use one of the language-specific [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk). If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail.

For the following services, only the "target" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS.

## About AWS costs

**Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges.** Our [`newrelic-log-ingestion` Lambda function](/docs/install-enable-new-relics-monitoring-aws-lambda#manual-nr-lambda), which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a [Third Party Service](/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy): AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.

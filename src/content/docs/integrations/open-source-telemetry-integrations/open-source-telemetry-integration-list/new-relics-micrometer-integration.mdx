[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. New Relic's Micrometer metrics registry sends your Micrometer telemetry data to your New Relic account.

Resources for our Micrometer integration:

* [README](https://github.com/newrelic/micrometer-registry-newrelic)
* [Integration specs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-exporter-specs/tree/master/micrometer)

## Find your data

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Your applications** > **Entity explorer**. From the **Entities** screen, search for your service by name. New Relic provides an out-of-the-box overview that includes charts for some of the most useful metrics provided by Micrometer Spring Boot instrumentation.

You can use the out-of-the-box overview as a starting point to build your own dashboards. Click on the `...` icon in a chart to add that chart to a dashboard or view the query behind the chart to modify it and it add it to your dashboard.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).

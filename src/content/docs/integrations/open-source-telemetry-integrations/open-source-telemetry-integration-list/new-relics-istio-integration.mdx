[Istio](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/mixer-overview/) provides a flexible model to enforce authorization policies and collect telemetry for the services in a mesh. New Relic's Istio adapter exports telemetry data from your Istio instance to your New Relic account.

Resources for our Istio adapter:

* [README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-istio-adapter)
* For Infinite tracing configuration examples, see [Integrations: Enable distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing)

## Find your data

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Your applications** > **Entity explorer**. From the **Entities** screen, search for your service by name. From there, you can explore your metrics using the **Data explorer** and build dashboards using your metrics. If you're also sending distributed tracing data, the distributed tracing feature is available to query and view traces.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).

[Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/) is a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services by providing metrics instrumentation out-of-the-box. New Relic's DropWizard reporter sends your Dropwizard metrics to your New Relic account.

Resources for our Dropwizard reporter:

* [Integration specs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-exporter-specs/tree/master/dropwizard)

## Find your data

To find your data, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") and go to **Your applications** > **Entity explorer**. From the entities screen, search for your service by name. From there, you can explore your metrics using the **Data explorer** and build dashboards using your metrics.

For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql).

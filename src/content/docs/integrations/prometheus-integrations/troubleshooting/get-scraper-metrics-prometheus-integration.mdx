## Problem

You want to get scraper metrics for your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration with New Relic for Docker or Kubernetes.

![Docker icon](./images/docker-logo-crop.png "Docker icon") **Docker:** If you configure the `http://localhost:8080/metrics` endpoint, the integration will also scrape its own metrics.

![img-integration-k8s@2x.png](./images/img-integration-k8s%402x.png "img-integration-k8s@2x.png") **Kubernetes:** By default, the scraper will also scrape its own metrics.

## Solution

To learn more about what is happening inside the scraper, use the following metrics for your Docker or Kubernetes integration with New Relic:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Metric
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `nr_stats_targets_total`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of scraped endpoints.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nr_stats_targets_failed_fetch`
      </td>

      <td>
        The number of endpoints where scraping is failing.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nr_stats_metrics_total`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of scraped metrics.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nr_stats_metrics_total_timeseries`
      </td>

      <td>
        The total number of scraped time series.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

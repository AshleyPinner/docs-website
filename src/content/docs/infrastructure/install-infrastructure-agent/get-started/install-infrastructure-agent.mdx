The infrastructure agent is a [lightweight](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-agent-performance-overhead) executable file that collects [data about your hosts](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events). It also forwards data from [infrastructure integrations](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) to New Relic, as well as [log data](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent) for log analytics.

There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure agent, depending on your setup and needs. Read on to understand how the infrastructure agent works and how to install it.

## One agent, many capabilities

Our infrastructure agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations), and [logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).

If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to [install the infrastructure agent](#install) first, and then [install or enable on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/install-infrastructure-host-integrations).

![Agents and New Relic](./images/Agents-and-NR-%288%29.png "Agents and New Relic")

The infrastructure agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services, and is able to [forward logs](/docs/logs/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent) to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate [language agents](/docs/agents). Notice how each integration and forwarder feed [different data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) in the New Relic database (NRDB).

## Install the infrastructure agent

The infrastructure agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/compatibility-requirements-infrastructure-agent) page.

### Linux

The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the [package manager](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-agent-linux-using-package-manager) of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions.

To use the links above, you must be logged to your New Relic account.

If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, [see our tutorial](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-agent-linux-using-package-manager). For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in [assisted](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-assisted-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) or [manual](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/tarball-manual-install-infrastructure-agent-linux) mode.

### Windows Server and 10

To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, [install it using our MSI installer](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer). For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions:

Windows

If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, [see our tutorial](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-windows-server-using-msi-installer). For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in [assisted](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/windows-installation/assisted-install-infrastructure-windows) or [manual](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/windows-installation/manual-install-infrastructure-windows) mode.

### Other install scenarios

The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools:

* ![Ansible](./images/ansible-red-logo.png "Ansible") [Ansible](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-using-ansible)
* ![Chef](./images/chef-logo.png "Chef") [Chef](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-using-chef)
* ![Docker](./images/docker-logo-crop.png "Docker") [Docker](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-container-infrastructure-monitoring) (install as container)
* ![EBS](./images/ebs.png "EBS")[Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/install-infrastructure-agent-aws-elastic-beanstalk)
* ![Puppet](./images/puppet-logo.png "Puppet") [Puppet](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-puppet)

## Check the source code

The infrastructure agent is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent) and [send improvements](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/README.md).

## What's next

After you've installed the infrastructure agent:

* Learn how to [configure the agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent) or edit the [config template](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/blob/master/assets/examples/infrastructure/newrelic-infra-template.yml.example).
* Install [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) (for example, for Apache or MySQL).
* [Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent](/docs/logs/enable-new-relic-logs/1-enable-logs/forward-your-logs-using-new-relic-infrastructure).
* Learn how to [manage the agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent).

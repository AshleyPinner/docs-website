You can filter your [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use.

## Why use facet filtering?

In [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards), for NRQL queries containing a [`FACET` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) and meeting other [chart-type requirements](#requirements), you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use.

This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard.

To see this feature in action, see the [example use case](#example-use).

## Requirements

Requirements to use this feature:

* Must be in [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards). Will not work on a standalone chart in the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
* NRQL query must contain a [`FACET` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet).
* Available only for [bar charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-barchart), [heat maps](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-heatmap), [pie charts](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-piechart), and [tables](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types#widget-table).

## Example use of facet filtering

Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One:

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: For queries containing a `FACET` clause and meeting [chart-type requirements](#requirements), you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select.

If you select **Filter the current dashboard**, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available `userAgentName` attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top.

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard.

## Summary

If the Node.js agent is configured to exclude the `request.uri` attribute, it will still capture the URI in transaction traces. This can be problematic for certain customers in environments where sensitive information is included in the URI.

**Release date:** August 20, 2020

**Vulnerability identifier:** NR20-02

**Priority:** Medium

## Affected software

The following New Relic agent versions are affected:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Name
      </th>

      <th>
        Affected version
      </th>

      <th>
        Remediated version
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Node.js agent
      </td>

      <td>
        &lt; 6.12.1
      </td>

      <td>
        6.12.1
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Vulnerability information

Even when users configure the Node.js agent to exclude the `request.uri` attribute, the agent will still capture the URI in transaction traces. This allows authenticated account users to view the URI anywhere transaction trace details can be viewed via New Relic One or queries. This includes (but is not limited to) the **Transaction traces** section of the **Transactions** page, the **Transaction trace details**, and the query builder in the UI.

### Mitigating factors

This will only affect Node.js agents configured to exclude the `request.uri` attribute.

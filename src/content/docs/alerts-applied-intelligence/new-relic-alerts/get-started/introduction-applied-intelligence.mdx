Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams.

At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, itâ€™s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time.

After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback.

## Why use Applied Intelligence?

How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster.

        Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples:

        * Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering.
        * Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue.
        * Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context.

        As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required.

        Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example:

        * Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback.
        * The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data.
        * You can create custom logic using the [decision builder](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/get-started-decisions).

## Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence

As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic.

To get started, see [Incident Intelligence](/docs/enable-new-relic-ai).

## Find unknowns with Proactive Detection

Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Because the problems that cause production incidents are often hard to see, Proactive Detection sends you this incident information when you need it. You can get this information sent through Slack or you can set up a webhook to deliver your messages.

To get started, see [Proactive Detection](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/proactive-detection-new-relic-ai).

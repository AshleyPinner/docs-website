Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see: You can use **muting rules** to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want.

Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent.

You can read more about why we added muting rules [in this blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/muting_rules_new_relic_alerts/).

## Manage muting rules

A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting.

You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & AI**, then click **Muting rules**. Muting rules can be enabled or disabled at any time.

Rules can have one of the following statuses:

* **Active**: Muting is enabled and active.
* **Scheduled**: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule).
* **Ended**: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule).
* **Inactive**: Muting is disabled.

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI > Muting rules**: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications.

## Create a muting rule

<Callout variant="tip">
  Before creating muting rules, you'll need to [create policies and conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy) that generate violation notifications.
</Callout>

To create a muting rule, click **+ Add a rule** in the **Muting rules** screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply.

Next, build the violation filter. You can use [violation event attributes](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes) and [sub-condition operators](#sub-conditions). Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name.

## Schedule a muting rule

If needed, you can schedule your muting rules.

To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last the whole day.

You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences.

## Manage muting rules with NerdGraph

In [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph), you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the [API Explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph#explorer).

* `actor.account.alerts.mutingRule`: Fetch a muting rule by id.
* `actor.account.alerts.mutingRules`: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account.
* `alertsMutingRuleCreate`: Create a muting rule for an account.
* `alertsMutingRuleUpdate:` Update a muting rule by id and account id.
* `alertsMutingRuleDelete:` Delete a muting rule by id and account id.

We've given you some sample queries and mutations [examples in this document](#examples).

A muting rule has the following fields and components:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Muting rule
      </th>

        `name` (**Required**)
      </td>

      <td>
        A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended.

      <td>
        `condition`
      </td>

      <td>
        The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has:

        * `operator`: The boolean operator `AND` or `OR` that defines how to combine the set of conditions.
        * `conditions`: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the `operator`. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule.

        A sub-condition has:

        * `attribute`: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of [Violation event attributes](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes).
        * `operator`: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of [sub-condition operators](#sub-conditions).
        * `values`: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as `IN`.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `schedule`

        The time window when the MutingRule should actively mute violations.

        * `startTime`: The datetime stamp that represents when the MutingRule should start. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00'
        * `endTime`: The datetime stamp that represents when the MutingRule should end. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00'
        * `timeZone`: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## How muting rules work

Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted.

A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a [violation event](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes). The muting rules tell us how to:

1. Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened.
2. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be "muted."

Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications.

Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system.

## View muted violations and incidents

When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as `Muted`:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & A**I, then click **Incidents.**

![Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule violations](./images/muting-rules-incident-violations.png "Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule violations")

An incident with a critical violation that's been muted.

Violations and incidents are marked as **Muted** in the **State** column when viewing lists of incidents, violations, or events:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & A**I, click **Incidents**, then click **Open incidents.**

![Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule incidents](./images/muting-rules-open-incidents.png "Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule incidents")

An example of an open incident that triggered the muting rule.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & A**I, then click **Events.**

![Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule critical violations](./images/muting-rules-violations_0.png "Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule critical violations")

An example of a list of violations. The **State** column shows which violations have been muted.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, in the top nav click **Alerts & A**I, click **Events**, then click **All events.**

![Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule events](./images/muting-rules-events.png "Alert incident lifecycle: Muting rule events")

An example of a list of alert events. The **State** column shows which events have been muted.

## Use attributes for muting

For an explanation of what attributes (metadata) is available for choosing what violations are muted, see [Violation event attributes](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes).

### Mute faceted results using `tag.`

To mute results of faceted queries, use the `tag.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE` attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL [`FACET` query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-facet) on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes `FACET host` in its query, you can target that `FACET` attribute using `tag.host`.

NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query `FACET` clause; for example: `FACET host, region, cluster`.

For an example of using `tag.`, see [Create muting rule](#create-rule).

## Sub-condition operators

The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see [Examples](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/muting-rules-suppress-notifications#examples).

* `EQUALS`: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value.
* `NOT_EQUALS`: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value.
* `IN`: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500).
* `NOT_IN`: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500).
* `CONTAINS`: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value.
* `NOT_CONTAINS`: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value.
* `ANY`: **Caution:** A condition with this operator will mute **all** violations on the account.
* `IS_BLANK`: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc.
* `IS_NOT_BLANK`: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc.
* `STARTS_WITH`: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string.
* `NOT_STARTS_WITH`: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string.
* `ENDS_WITH`: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string.
* `NOT_ENDS_WITH`: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

Our [Trace API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-new-relic-trace-api) accepts two types of data formats:

* `zipkin` for Zipkin trace data
* [`newrelic`](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/report-new-relic-format-traces-trace-api) for all other trace data

This document explains how to send Zipkin data.

## Zipkin version requirements

The Trace API supports data from [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see [Zipkin v2 release details](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/releases/tag/2.0.0) and the [Zipkin v2 schema](https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans).

## Quick start: Send Zipkin data via `curl` request

This procedure describes how to send a simple Zipkin trace to New Relic. Alternatively, you can go to [Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation](#existing-zipkin).

  Note that this is only a simple trace, in order to show you how the API works. In practice, you might have a more complex trace structure, with additional attributes.

1. Get an [Insights insert API key](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api#): Go to the [API keys UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) and select **Insights insert keys**. If you don't already have a key, create a new one by selecting **Insert keys +**.
2. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Tips:

   * To copy the JSON, hover over the code to see a **Copy** button.
   * If you send more than one post, change the trace.id to a different value. Sending the same payload or span `id` multiple times for the same `traceId` may result in fragmented traces in the UI.

   ```

    -H 'Api-Key: NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY' \
    -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \

                "kind": "CLIENT",

                    "port": 8080
                },
                "tags": {
                }
            },
            {
                "traceId": "test-zipkin-trace-id-1",
                "parentId": "3e0f5885710776cd",
                "id": "asdf9asdn123lkasdf",
                "kind": "CLIENT",
                "name": "service 2 span",
                "duration": 2019,

                    "serviceName": "service-2",
                    "ipv4": "127.0.0.1",
                    "port": 8080
                },
                "tags": {
                }
            }
        ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1'
   ```

Within a minute, the trace should be available in the [our distributed tracing UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/distributed-tracing-nerdlets.distributed-tracing). To find it, run a query for the `trace.id`. In this example, it was `test-zipkin-trace-id-1` and we search by the translated term of `trace.id`.

## Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation

To report data from your Zipkin instrumentation, you will point the Zipkin tracer at the Trace API endpoint (`https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1`) with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers).

Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin `OkHttpSender` in Java configured for the Trace API:

```
OkHttpSender.create("https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2");
```

For an explanation of `Api-Key` and the other metadata, see [Request metadata](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-endpoint-requirements-limits#headers-query-parameters).

## Transformation of Zipkin data

To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see [How distributed tracing works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works).

## Add other tags/attributes

You can add any tags you want to the `tags` block, with the exception of the [restricted tags](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-endpoint-requirements-limits#restricted-attributes). For example, you might want to add attributes like `customer.id` or `user.id` to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute).

To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see [Decorate spans](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-decorate-spans-attributes).

With [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign) (AUM), your users and groups in your identity provider (like OneLogin or Okta) are synchronized with New Relic.

## How groups work with your users

All group administration happens within your identity provider. If your existing groups logically map to access in New Relic, we recommend sending your existing groups. This makes providing and changing access to New Relic from within your identity provider easy.

In the above example, letâ€™s focus on the Engineers group. Via SCIM, New Relic will receive the two user records as well as the information that they belong to the Engineers group. With the current configuration, the two Engineer users have **Read only** access to Account 1, **Standard user** access to Account 2, and **All product admin** access to Account 3.

This access is given by creating three grants within New Relic:

* Role **Read only** to group **Engineers** on Account 1
* Role **Standard user** to group **Engineers** on Account 2
* Role **All product admin** to group **Engineers** on Account 3

## Available roles

See [New Relic standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#standard-roles).

New Relic One  
user model

In mid-2020, New Relic released a newer user model, referred to as the New Relic One user model. Here are the users on this user model:

* Users on New Relic organizations created on or after July 30 2020.
* Users on older accounts who were [added via automated user management](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#convert-aum).

<Callout variant="important">
  If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, your users are likely on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). For more on this, see [Pricing and user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#determine-user-model).
</Callout>

This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including:

* [User type](#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
* [User groups](#groups)
* [User roles](#roles)
* [Capability limitations](#limitations)

For how to add and manage users, see [User management](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants).

## User type: basic and full

The user type determines the monitoring and analysis features a user has access to, and is a key factor in [billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing). (Note that user type does **not** control account admin-related permissions; that's determined by the [user group](#groups).)

There are two user types:

* **Basic user:**
  * These users are free and have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do **not** have access to Full-Stack Observability features. For details, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities).
  * No matter what group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the [capabilities of a basic user](#user-capabilities): no more and no less.
  * Basic users can upgrade on their own to become full users (with exception of [users on original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#convert-users)). Basic users are prompted to upgrade themselves when they attempt to access a feature available only to full users.
* **Full user:**
  * These users are billable and have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which includes our curated UI experiences, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see [Capabilities](#user-capabilities).
  * The Standard [pricing tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) includes one free full user and up to five total.

    Below is a detailed table showing differences between basic user and full user capabilities. In short, basic users have access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](https://newrelic.com/platform) and [Applied Intelligence](https://newrelic.com/platform) (read-only) features, while full users have access to that plus [Full-Stack Observability](https://newrelic.com/platform) features.

    Reasons to make someone a full user:

    * They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle.
    * They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team.
    * They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD).
    * They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform.
    * They need to be able to manage users.

    Reasons to make someone a basic user:

    * They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle.
    * They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team).
    * They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives).
    * They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform.
    * They don't manage users.

## User groups

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

A user group allows managing multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group and that group is granted access to specific roles and specific accounts.

We have two default user groups you can add users to:

* **User**: Adding someone to this group allows them to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but **not** perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users.
* **Admin**: Adding someone to this group gives them the abilities of the User group and also gives them access to account/organization-related abilities like managing billing-related settings and managing users.

See the [roles and capabilities these default groups have](#group-roles).

Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can create their own [custom roles and custom groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/organization-level-user-management-roles-groups-access-grants).

## Roles and capabilities

<Callout variant="important">
  This applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models). For users on our original user model, see [Original user docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles).
</Callout>

Roles are a set of capabilities. A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' ([see more examples](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants#custom-role)).

We provide some default standard roles (below). Pro and Enterprise tier accounts can also create [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants#custom-role).

### Standard roles

Our standard roles are default sets of capabilities that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. These standard roles are [assigned to our default **Admin** and **User** groups](#group-roles), but you can also assign these roles to a custom group.

Most standard roles have capabilities that are unique and that can't be replicated with a custom role. For example, to assign billing management capabilities to a user, you'd need to assign them the **Billing user** role; you wouldn't be able to assign billing management capability with a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with custom roles are **Read only**, **Standard user**, and **All product admin** (this role is the equivalent of choosing all available capabilities).

Standard roles include:

### Roles and user groups

There are two default user groups available: [**User** and **Admin**](#groups). These groups have our [standard roles](#standard-roles) applied in these ways:

* **User**: this group has only the **All product admin** standard role, which grants general platform access and some basic admin capabilities.
* **Admin**: this group has all the standard roles, giving it complete admin capabilities.

Custom groups can be assigned standard roles or custom roles.

### Roles and user type

User type refers to whether a user is a basic user or a full user.

A basic user can be defined as having the **All product admin** [standard role](#standard-roles) but without access to Full-Stack Observability features ([learn more](#user-type)). A basic user always has basic user capabilities, no more and no less, regardless of what group they're assigned to. One nonintuitive impact of this is that a group's basic users could have more capabilities than its full users have. For example, if you created a custom group with very minimal capabilities, the full users in that group would have those minimal capabilities, but any basic users in that group would have more capabilities than the full users because the capabilities of a basic user trump group capabilities.

A full user's capabilities will depend on its assigned group; it has theoretical access to all roles and capabilities.

For more on this, see [User type](#user-type).

### Custom roles and capabilities

For tips on setting up custom roles, see [Add custom groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).

## Manage users

New Relic One  
user model

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). [Learn about user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
</Callout>

We provide several ways for you to manage your New Relic users. Here are our main user management docs:

* [User model/structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles): an explanation of basic aspects of our account/user structure, such as user type (basic user vs full user), default groups (**Admin** and **User**), and our standard user roles.
* [Managing users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): basics of New Relic user management concepts.
  * A [tutorial on how to add new groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model)
* [User authentication](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): configure how users are added to New Relic (manually or automatically from an identity provider), and the authentication method (via manual login or SAML SSO).

Your number of full users is a factor in your billing. For more on that, see [User count billing calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#user-count).

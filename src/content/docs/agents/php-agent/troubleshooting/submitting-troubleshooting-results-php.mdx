## Problem

You continue to have problems with installing the New Relic PHP agent.

## Solution

If you continue to have problems with your New Relic PHP installation after following the [troubleshooting tips](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting), get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com "Link opens in a new window").

When working with a New Relic Technical Support engineer, provide the following information:

* How far have you progressed in the installation process
* Which installation method you are using
* A copy your `newrelic.cfg` file (if any)
* A link to your **phpinfo** page, or the output of **phpinfo** saved as an HTML file. To [create **phpinfo**](/docs/php/php-kb-103), create a .php webpage containing just:

  ```
  <?php phpinfo(); ?>
  ```
* Your [agent and daemon log files](/docs/php/php-kb-105)

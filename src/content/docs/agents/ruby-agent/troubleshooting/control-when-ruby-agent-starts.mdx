## Problem

The Ruby agent is not properly starting or is not reporting data to New Relic.

## Solution

To solve this problem:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="version-3-6-1-or-later"
    title="Check your Ruby agent version."
  >
    Check your [Ruby agent version](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes), and update if necessary.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="environment"
    title="Check the app environment used."
  >
    When the `newrelic_rpm` Ruby gem is required in your application environment, it will attempt to determine whether to start monitoring automatically and begin transmitting metrics to New Relic, or to remain disabled.

    * Production and staging: The agent typically is configured to monitor automatically in these environments.
    * Test and development: The agent typically remains disabled in these environments.

    To control this logic, set the `monitor_mode` configuration key to `true` or `false` in each environment section of `newrelic.yml`.

    To override the agent's auto-start logic, the easiest mechanism is to set a `NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=true` environment variable; for example:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=true rake assets:precompile
    ```
  </Collapser>

    If you are running Ruby agent version 3.6.1 or higher, there are a few reasons the agent will refuse to start:

    * The agent detects it is in an interactive session; for example, a `rails console` or `irb` session.
    * The agent detects it is in one of Rails' built-in rake tasks; for example, `assets:precompile` or `db:migrate`.

    You can use configuration variables in your Ruby agent `newrelic.yml` file to customize auto-start behavior for constants, script names, and rake tasks.

            ```
            autostart.denylisted_constants
            ```

            * Ruby constants that should prevent the agent from starting. Accepts a comma separated list.
            * Defaults to `"Rails::Console"`.
            * Set to `""` to tell the agent to start when `Rails::Console` is in the environment.

          <td>
            ```
            autostart.denylisted_rake_tasks
            ```

            * Rake tasks you do not want the agent to monitor; for example, `assets:precompile`. Accepts a comma-separated list.
            * We do not disable the Ruby agent in all rake tasks, because tasks like `resque:work` generally are monitored.

          <td>
            ```
            autostart.denylisted_executables
            ```

            * A list of script names, such as `irb`, that will prevent the agent from starting automatically. Accepts a comma-separated list.
            * Set this to `"rake"` to prevent the agent from starting in rake tasks, or `"rake,my_ruby_script.rb"` to prevent it from starting in rake and a custom script.

This documentation explains requirements and tips for integrating the Python agent with an app that uses Tornado 6. To return to the general install instructions, go to [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

<Callout variant="important">
  The Python agent does not support any versions of Tornado below 6.0.
</Callout>

## Automatic initialization with admin script

You can use the recommended [admin script integration method](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration), provided you start your app with `python app.py` and use the Tornado async interface. Here's an example of using the admin script method:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=path/to/newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python app.py
```

Manual integration in your app code is allowed but not recommended. See [Manual integration instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration) for more information.

## Event loop diagnostic support

The Python agent supports asyncio event loop diagnostics. See [Python event loop diagnostics](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-event-loop-diagnostics) for more information.

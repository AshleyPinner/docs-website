You can install the [New Relic C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/get-started/introduction-c-sdk) on a Docker container (or other container) to monitor one or more of your C applications.

## Install C SDK in container environment

Requirements:

* Meet [C SDK requirements](/docs/agents/c-sdk/get-started/c-sdk-compatibility-requirements)
* C SDK version 1.2 or higher

To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the [C SDK daemon](/docs/agents/c-sdk/get-started/introduction-c-sdk#architecture) on a separate docker container:

<Callout variant="caution">
  Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is **not** encrypted. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts).
</Callout>

1. Set up a daemon container:
   1. Install the daemon by cloning the [C SDK repository](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk) and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command `make daemon`. See the [README.md](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/README.md#building-the-c-sdk) for further details.
   2. Start the daemon using `--address` and `--watchdog-foreground` arguments. The `--address` argument is used to set a port the daemon is accepting connections on. The `--watchdog-foreground` argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground.
2. Use the C SDK in your containerized application:
   1. Follow the steps to [add the C SDK to your code](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code).
   2. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a [`newrelic_init` call](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a03f07e64a51b5f0cd51caa4f28c8b6c1) and passing a valid `address` argument. The value for this argument needs to be `HOST:PORT`, where `HOST` is the name or IP address of the host the daemon is running on, and `PORT` is the port number the daemon is listening on.

### New features

* We now support multiple email addresses logged in at the same time.

### Improvements

* Improved login flow

### Bug fixes

* Fixed some issues where network failures or server issues would log you out. Now you can retry, instead of being logged out.
* We fixed a UI bug where larger screen sizes would not display the right most columns of facet or event tables properly.

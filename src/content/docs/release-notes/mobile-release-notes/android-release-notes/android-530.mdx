### Improvements

* This release adds a new API method `withApplicationBuild(String build)` which replaces the now deprecated method, `withBuildIdentifier(String build)`. The functionality remains the same, allowing the application build to be set rather than relying on the `versionCode`. See [Android API documentation](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-sdk-api/new-relic-mobile-sdk-api/work-android-sdk-api) for details.
* Log messages from the Android SDK have been updated to reflect updated New Relic support team contact information.

### Fixes

* This release improves UI performance when an app has crashed and that crash is being sent to New Relic.
* The logic for sampling memory and CPU resources during an interaction trace was improved to limit the use of system resources.
* A crash was addressed in a rare instance when the Apache `BasicHttpRequest` library was used for networking purposes.

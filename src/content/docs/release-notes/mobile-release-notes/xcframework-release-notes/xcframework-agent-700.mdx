### Notes

The New Relic XCFramework Agent is the updated distribution method for the iOS & tvOS agent. Starting with the 7.0.0 release, all future updates will be deployed via the XCFramework agent. The XCFramework agent will be distributed via the NewRelicAgent cocoapods, as well as via download.

### New features

* [Dynamic Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/OverviewOfDynamicLibraries.html) support. This will greatly improve support for shared frameworks instrumentation.

### Notes

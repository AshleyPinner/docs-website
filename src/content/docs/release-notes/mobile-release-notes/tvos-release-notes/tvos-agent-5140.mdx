### New in this release

Now reports network request events to Insights! This feature must be enabled when starting the agent using `[NewRelic enableFeatures:NRFeatureFlag_NetworkRequestEvents]`. When enabled all network calls will be tracked, in addition to network errors. These new events will be available under the MobileNetworkRequest eventType.

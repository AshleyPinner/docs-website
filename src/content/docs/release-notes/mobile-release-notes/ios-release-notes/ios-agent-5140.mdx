### New in this release

Now reports network request events to Insights! This feature must be enabled when starting the agent using `[NewRelic enableFeatures:NRFeatureFlag_NetworkRequestEvents]`. When enabled all network calls will be tracked, in addition to network errors. These new events will be available under the MobileNetworkRequest eventType. Examples of how to query these new events is available in our documentation: [Mobile request query examples (MobileRequest)](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-attributes/mobile-request-query-examples-mobilerequest).

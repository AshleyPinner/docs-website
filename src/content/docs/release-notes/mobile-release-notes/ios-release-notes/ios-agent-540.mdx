### Improvements

* Added new feature flag, `NRFeatureFlag_DefaultInteraction`, which allows default interactions to be disabled. Disabling this feature flag will allow the agent to only capture custom interactions.

### Fixes

* Corrected warnings inadvertently caused by new Xcode build setting, `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES = YES`.

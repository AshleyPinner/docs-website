### Improvements

* This release adds a new Insights event type: `MobileRequestError`. This new event tracks networking and http errors during the app's lifecycle, adding the ability to slice and dice network error data! More details can be found at [Mobile Request Error Events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobilerequesterror-events-insights).
* This agent now applies the `lastInteraction` attribute to all events, not just crash events.
* The applicationsÂ build value is now added as a default session attribute: `appBuild`.

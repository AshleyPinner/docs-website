### Notes

**Fixes**

* Fixed \[AFURLSessionManager disposition]: unrecognized selector crash.
* Crashes in NRURLProtocol client call backs should no longer occur.
* Fixed C++ compilation error caused by the New Relic Agent feature flags.

**Improvements**

* Added new flag for NRFeatureFlags: NRFeatureFlag_ExperimentalNetworkingInstrumentation. This forces all network traffic to run through the NRURLProtocol, normally only traffic on UIWebViews are routed through the NRURLProtocol. It is not recommended to enable this flag.

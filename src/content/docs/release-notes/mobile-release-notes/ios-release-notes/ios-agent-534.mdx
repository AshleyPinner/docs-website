### Improvements

* Added new Insights attributes tracking new app installs and upgrades, for the upcoming [Mobile Version Trends Report](https://blog.newrelic.com/2015/11/12/mobile-version-trends-report/).

### Fixes

* Fixed missing [Cross Application Trace](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing) header in HTTP Error data. This will result in more detailed data in HTTP Errors dashboards.
* Off-loaded interaction event generation from main thread to background thread. This caused UI sluggishness under extreme circumstances

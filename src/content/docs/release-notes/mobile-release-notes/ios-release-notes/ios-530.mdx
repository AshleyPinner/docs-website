### Improvements

* This release adds support for building apps with Xcode 7. Xcode 6 and earlier are no longer supported. If you require Xcode 6, use [version 5.2.2](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-522) or earlier of the iOS agent.
* This release also adds Bitcode support, used in apps with Bitcode enabled (Bitcode is enabled by default in Xcode 7).

### Notes

* As of this release, the New Relic iOS agent no longer supports iOS 5. The minimum required version is now iOS 6.

### New Features

* Added CPM [environment variable](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/containerized-private-minion-cpm-configuration#environment-variables) **MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED** for a Docker container system environment and **synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled** for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment to allow disabling public network health checks on boot

### Improvements

* More precisely reflect full timeout set for **MINION_CHECK_TIMEOUT** env variable

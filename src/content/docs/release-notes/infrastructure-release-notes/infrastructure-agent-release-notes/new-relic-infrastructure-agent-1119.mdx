### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### New Features

* Adds support for running integrations as different users by setting the `integration_user` attribute in the instances section of the config file.
* Stops setting the `NRIA_CACHE_PATH` variable for integrations. This variable was used by pre-V3 SDK integrations for storing cache data. Without it the integrations will default to a `/tmp` directory like SDK V3 integrations.
* Attaches `integration_user` attribute to the integration samples.
* Adds new user/group `nri-agent` to be used in different user modes.

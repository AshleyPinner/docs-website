### Notes

A new version of the Windows agent has been released, fixing a security issue that allowed non-privileged users with access to the system to inject configuration arguments to the agent external plugins.

Please see [New Relic Security Bulletin NR18-10](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-10) for more details.

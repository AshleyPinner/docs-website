### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Support for Windows AppData for all data cache, user_data, and integration related temp files. The log file is also written to %AppData%/New Relic/newrelic-infra/...instead of the Program Files location.
* Integrations can now invoke executables from the system path without using an absolute path to them, and the value of $PATH is passed through to integration executables
* For agents deployed inside containers, the Linux distribution and version will now reflect the parent host rather than the OS within the container itself

### Added

* New `StorageSample` metrics. Please refer to the [New Relic event data dictionary](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary) for a detailed description of them.
  * Linux-only storage metrics: `inodesFree`, `inodesUsed`, `inodesTotal` and `inodesUsedPercent`.
  * Windows-only storage metrics: `avgQueueLen`, `avgReadQueueLen`, `avgWriteQueueLen` and `currentQueueLen`.

### Security notes

* Windows package gets flagged by Windows-Defender on some machines. Use newer versions instead.

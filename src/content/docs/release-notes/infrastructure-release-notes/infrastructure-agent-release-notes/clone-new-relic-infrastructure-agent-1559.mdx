### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Bug fixes

* When a wrong agent id was set up prior to have a cloud-id, agent was not able to migrate to a new more stable id once it got cloud-id. Now agent id is updated and new data is therefor attached to this more stable cloud-id.

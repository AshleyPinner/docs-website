### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Added

* [Samplers](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#samples-variables) that are disabled are no longer pre-warmed avoiding errors messages in the log.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue with the containerized agent where the agent would crash when the container is stopped
* Fixed an issue in Linux where in some situations the process display name would be empty
* Fixed an issue where in certain situations the unavailability of cpu metrics would lead to a crash

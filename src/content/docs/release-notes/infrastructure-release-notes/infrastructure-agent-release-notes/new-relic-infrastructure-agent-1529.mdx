### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changed

### Windows specific

* All executables are now signed.
* Added versioning info to newrelic-infra-ctl.exe.
* These changes should avoid Defender to flag the package as threat.

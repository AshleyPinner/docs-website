### Notes

New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See [Update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent) for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.

Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.

### Improvements

* Agent proxy config no longer appears in the inventory UI. This is to prevent information leaks

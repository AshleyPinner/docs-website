### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changed

* Improve trial management mechanism in Agent
* Add support for including extra attributes in the Events; before, events only supported a summary and category field, now extra attributes can be defined.

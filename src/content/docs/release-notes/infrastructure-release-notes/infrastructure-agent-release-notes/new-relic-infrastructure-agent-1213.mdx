### Notes

A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update your Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).

### Changes

* Creation of `nri-agent` only when environment variable NRIA_MODE is set to `PRIVILEGED` or `UNPRIVILEGED`.
* Log when `docker_api_version` is not supported.

### Bug fixes

* Agent: Fix system sampler disk metrics problem when the same device is mounted multiple times causing increased values.

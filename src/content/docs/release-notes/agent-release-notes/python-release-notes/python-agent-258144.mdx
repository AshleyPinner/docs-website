### Notes

This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem where the package failed to install under certain circumstances.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from our [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/).

For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see [Status of the Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent).

### Bug Fix

The `README.rst` file contained non-ASCII characters, which could result in a `UnicodeDecodeError` during installation. Those characters have been removed.

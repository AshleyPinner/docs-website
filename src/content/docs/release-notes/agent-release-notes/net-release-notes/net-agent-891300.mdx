### Fixes

Added auto instrumentation to prevent associating Serilog PeriodicBatchingSink activity with an applicationâ€™s transactions.

### New Features

Added [API support](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) for manually creating and accepting distributed tracing payloads.

### Upgrading

* Follow standard procedures to [update the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to [upgrade legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents).

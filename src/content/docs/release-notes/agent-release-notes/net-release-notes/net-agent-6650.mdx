### Fixes

* Fixes an issue where query string parameters of a request's referrer URL get sent to APM when they should not be. For more information see the security bulletin [https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-b...](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-02)
* The Status Monitor now verifies that the application link points to the New Relic domain before loading the URI in the browser, when the user selects the 'View application in New Relic' button in the Status Monitor.

### Upgrading

* For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net).
* If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see [Upgrading legacy .NET agents](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents) for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.

### Notes

New Features

* Updated the logo used in the installer.

Fixes

* Allow medium-trust .NET applications to be monitored. We accomplished this by adding the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers assembly attribute to all of our .NET assemblies. This also reduces assembly load overhead in some environments.
* Minor improvements to debug logging.
* Fix parsing of sql commands so that the metric name is based on a SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE-style command instead of supporting commands such as SET (as in SET NOCOUNT).
* Improvement error handling in agent to avoid null reference exceptions.
* Added comments to the NewRelic.AgentApi programmer interface for intellisense support.
* Diagnostic tool now warns instead of reporting an error if COR_ENABLE_PROFILING is not set to 1.

End of Life

<Callout variant="important">

### Notes

* Agent can be configured to not send JVM arguments to the New Relic server

  The property send_jvm_props can be set to false, which will cause JVM arguments to no longer be sent to the server. Use this setting if you set sensitive system properties on the command line.
* Agent reports full URL in external service calls for transaction traces

  The agent now will provide the full URL if available in transaction traces for external calls.
* Fix: ResinServletTracerFactory no longer causing SkipServletTracerFactory errors

  When hitting the ResinServletTracerFactory inside a transaction, a SkipServletTracerFactory excetion will no longer be thrown.
* Agent logging improvements

  We have improved the clarity of logging messages, adjusted logging levels to be more appropriate, and increased logging performance.

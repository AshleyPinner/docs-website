End of Life

<Callout variant="important">
  The end-of-life date for this agent version is July 29, 2019. To update to the latest agent version, see [Update the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent). For more information, see [End-of-life policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).
</Callout>

### Notes

* Plain `http` routes (i.e. routes outside of a framework) now apply config naming rules early. See [rules for naming and ignoring requests](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#rules-for-naming-and-ignoring-requests).

  This fixes a bug where generating the _Browser Timing Header_ would not work without a framework (i.e. express, restify, hapi).
* _Beta_ support for connecting to newrelic via ssl through a proxy.

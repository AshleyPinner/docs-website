### New features

* Feature flags may now be set from environment variables.

  Using the naming convention `NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG_<feature flag name in upper case>`.

### Improvements

* Transaction events may be harvested in two payloads now.

  This change reduces the occurrence of harvests being rejected due to large payloads. Payloads will only be split when they are large (greater than 1/3 the maximum).

### Bug fixes

* Updated Hapi v17 instrumentation to wrap `server` export, in addition to `Server`.

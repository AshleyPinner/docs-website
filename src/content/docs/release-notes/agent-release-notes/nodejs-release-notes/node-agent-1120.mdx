### Notes

* Added support for Cross Application Tracing

  The agent now supports [Cross Application Tracing](/docs/apm/traces/cross-application-traces/cross-application-traces), which allows the New Relic APM UI to display traces that span multiple applications.
* Fixed a bug that would cause application to crash on request when using the kraken framework.
* Loosened the restrictions on the `app_name` setting. Application names may now include any Unicode characters.

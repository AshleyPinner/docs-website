### Notes

* Express and Connect instrumentation will no longer crash on Node 4

  As of ES6, the `Function.name` attribute will track if the function is a getter/a setter/is bound to (i.e. `fn.bind().name ->` `'bound ' + fn.name`). This new behavior caused the agent to crash on start up due to the way connect and express are instrumented. The agent is now more defensive of future implementations of ES6.

* Fixed a crash in express instrumentation in the handling of sub-routers.
* Fixed a crash in http outbound connections when CAT is enabled and another library has frozen the http request headers.
* Updated version checking to allow versions of the runtime >= 1.0.0. Thanks to [Mark Stosberg](https://github.com/markstos) for this patch!

### Improvements

* Removed installation of Oracle container test scripts.
* Replaced explicit `config.high_security === true` checks with general truthiness checks.

  The agent will now treat any truthy value in the `high_security` config setting as if it is enabled.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bug where agent would stop sending data to New Relic servers when a connectivity issue was encountered.
* Fixed unit test with incorrect usage of cross application tracing.

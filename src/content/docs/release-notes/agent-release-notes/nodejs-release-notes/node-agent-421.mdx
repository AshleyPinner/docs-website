### Improvements

* Added more tests for transaction naming with Restify.

### Fixes

* Fixed issue with tracking external requests to default ports.

  Special thanks to Ryan King for pinpointing the cause of this issue.
* Added extra check for handling arrays of functions when wrapping middleware mounters.

  This fixes a bug with the agent incorrectly assuming that arrays passed as the first argument in middleware would only contain route paths, causing a fatal error.
* The agent now reports the total time of the transaction on transaction events.

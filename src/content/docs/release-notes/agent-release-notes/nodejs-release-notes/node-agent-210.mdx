### Improvements

* Improved metadata collection for AWS, Azure, GCE, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in PG query obfuscation for `$` placeholders.

  The agent used to mis-detect `$1` value placeholders as unmatched dollar-quoted strings causing the whole query to be obfuscated to just `?`. These placeholders are now correctly detected and obfuscated.

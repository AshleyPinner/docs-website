### New Features

* To easily distinguish dynamically assigned hosts, users can now assign a display name to a host with the setting [`newrelic.process_host.display_name`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-process_host-display_name).
* The New Relic PHP Agent now supports the latest Production Release of 64-bit [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/), which is currently at 10.2-RELEASE.

### Upgrade Notices

* Transactions run under PHP's CLI Web server will now report as Web transactions instead of background transactions. If you want the agent to continue reporting them as background transactions, use the [`newrelic_background_job()`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-api#api-bg) API function to mark the transaction as a background job.

### Notes

* The agent now collects the following information in web transactions (not yet shown in the New Relic UI): Accept, Host, Content-Length, and Content-Type HTTP request headers, and HTTP request method.

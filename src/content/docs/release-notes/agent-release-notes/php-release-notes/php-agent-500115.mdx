### New Features

* Users can now delete applications from the UI after 20 minutes of inactivity. Previously, this required a restart of the New Relic PHP daemon.

### Upgrade Notices

* We rearchitected the daemon to enable future improvements.
* Daemon log levels are now simpler. While `verbose` and `verbosedebug` will still work, `debug` now gives you all the debugging information. Agent log levels remain unchanged.

### End of Life Notices

* For the few customers who start the daemon manually, the newly renamed command-line flags can be found with the `-h` or `--help` flags. The following old flags will be removed in a future release:
  * \[-p pidfile]
  * \[-d level]
  * \[-c config]
  * \[-l logfile]
  * \[-P port]
  * \[-s]
  * \[-n]
  * \[-b SSL-certificate-bundle]
  * \[-S SSL-certificate-path]
  * \[-H host]
  * \[-x proxy]
  * \[-a auditlog]

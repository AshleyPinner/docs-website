### New Features

* The agent will now gather more information about the host system, including whether the system is running on Docker or AWS. This will be used to support upcoming features.

### Notes

* We've changed the timestamp source for error events, which drive the Error Analytics page. Previously, the event's timestamp was the transaction's start time. It is now the time when the error occurred.

### Notes

* Public API for External Requests

  The agent now has public API for instrumenting external requests and linking up transactions via cross application tracing. See the [API Guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-agent-api-guide#externals) for more details on this new functionality.

For memcached only, multi requests will expand to individual server nodes, and the operation and key(s) will show in the trace details "Database query" section. Metrics for `get_multi` nodes will change slightly. Parent nodes for a `get_multi` will be recorded as generic segments. Their children will be recorded as datastore segments under the name `get_multi_request` and represent a batch request to a single Memcached instance.

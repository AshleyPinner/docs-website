**New Relic One** ([one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com)) is the platform that gives you access to our [Telemetry Data Platform](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform), our [Full-Stack Observability](/docs/full-stack-observability/monitor-everything/get-started-new-relic-monitoring-tools/get-started-full-stack-observability#h2-start-anywhere) features, and our [Applied Intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence) features.

## Find New Relic One

To find New Relic One:

* If you report data to the [EU data center](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center): go to [one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com).
* Otherwise: go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).

## A more consistent and unified platform

Before our release of New Relic One, our platform was separated into various products, like APM, Browser, and Mobile. With our move to New Relic One, you can view and interact with all the data from across your entire system more easily.

For more about our transition to the New Relic One UI, see [New Relic One transition guide](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-transition-guide-july-2020).

## Quickly understand context

New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity and allows you to:

* Organize your environments and manage data more effectively with [tags](/node/29366/). Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems.
* View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. [Cross-account access](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/cross-account-features-security) brings all types of data together while still making everything easy to find.
* Group any entities together into functional team-focused or project-focused groupings with [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-workloads-create-groupings-entities).
* Tailor [custom dashboards](#dashboards) for your unique needs. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance, and make the most of your expertise.
* Get more context while you query with the [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder) which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries.

## Know your relationships and dependencies

We provide multiple ways to understand dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "350px" }}>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Use this
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        See how each part of your system is connected.
      </td>

      <td>
        [Service maps](/docs/service-maps-new-relic-one) illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Organize everything you monitor and provide context for your entities.
      </td>

      <td>
        Add [tags](/docs/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) to all your entities.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Understand how everything is connected via API.
      </td>

      <td>
        The [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api) manages all your entities, tags, and relationships.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        View a list of all the dependencies for a service.
      </td>

      <td>
        The [dependencies](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-dependencies-page) view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing.

        Know which teams are responsible for specific entities across your organization.

## Query your data more easily

At the top of all UI pages, **Query your data** is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts:

* Browse your data in a query-less experience with our [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer).
* Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the [NRQL mode query builder](/docs/specify-data-chart#use-advanced).

## Enhanced dashboards

![Dashboards in New Relic One](./images/NR1-dashboards-image.png "NR1-dashboards-image.png")

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One.

New Relic One [dashboards](/docs/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) lets you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize.

Dashboard features include:

* Perform [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql) queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder).
* [Manage your charts and dashboards](/docs/explore-dashboards-index) easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options.
* Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time.
* Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics.
* [Send data](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights) to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs.
* Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are [available as New Relic One dashboards](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights).
</Callout>

## Build on New Relic One

If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that:

* Live on [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), alongside your other New Relic-monitored data.
* Feature highly tailored visualizations.
* Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API.

And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps.

To learn more, see [New Relic One applications](/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction).

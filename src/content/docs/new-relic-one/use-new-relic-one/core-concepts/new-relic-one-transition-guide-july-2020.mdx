Welcome to [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one)! We’ve streamlined and enhanced your Full-Stack Observability platform to make it open, connected, and programmable. This transition guide explains how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals you’re used to doing in New Relic, and more!

We will continue to improve and simplify your experience with the New Relic One platform. As always, we're here to help, and we also want to learn what you like and dislike about your new experience.

## Get started

New Relic One is a unified user experience that makes it easier for you to navigate the platform, find and diagnose problems, and take advantage of new, more powerful features. To get started, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) or [one.eu.newrelic.com](https://one.eu.newrelic.com) as applicable.

![NR One transition: home page 070120](./images/nr1-home070120.png "NR One transition: home page 070120")

To customize your New Relic One experience, you can add your favorite apps, teams, and other resources to your homepage.

From the New Relic One homepage, you can:

* See the current health across your ecosystem.
* Troubleshoot problems and find patterns in anomalies.
* Query data and share information with others.
* Find areas to optimize performance.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If your New Relic One homepage is blank when you first visit it, add your favorite apps, services, teams, etc. to it. Then the homepage will have everything important about your ecosystem's resources in one place, including their current health, alert patterns and violations, and links to more details and resources.

New Relic One has multiple ways to [query and chart your data](#explore-data) from the **Dashboards** link on the top nav. That's why Insights is not listed there. However, you can still access your old Insights dashboards and data from the **More** dropdown at the top of the homepage, or simply click **Dashboards**. Learn more about how to make the [transition from Insights to New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights).

## Get started with instrumentation

![NR One transition: add more icon 070620](./images/nrone-icon-add-more070620.png "NR One transition: add more icon") Get data from your stack flowing into New Relic from a single location, and stay up to date with the latest agents, integrations, and reporting services.

* If you're already using New Relic One: At the top of the UI, click **Add more**, then search for or select whatever you want.
* If your New Relic One homepage is blank: Click **Add more data**, then search for or select whatever you want.

![NR One transition: Add more data page](./images/nrone-transition-add-data-page-070620.png "NR One transition: Add more data page")

When you click **Add more**, New Relic One presents a unified page where you can extend your instrumentation with any programming languages and frameworks you need.

The UI immediately provides interactive steps to select the languages and frameworks you need.

## Explore your data

Collect, explore, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from any source with our open and unified telemetry database. Automatic integrations for open-source tools enable easy setup, eliminating the cost and complexities of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems or data stores.

To use a single resource where you can explore any data type, including metrics, events, logs, and traces: At the top of any New Relic One page, click the **Query your data** icon.

![NR One transition: explore data](./images/explore-data-icon.png "NR One transition: explore data")

We offer several ways to help you explore your data:

* If you don't want to use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language), use the data explorer to navigate your data and create customized visualizations.
* If you're new to running queries, go to the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), where you can run queries and build charts using our assisted (basic) mode.
* If you're comfortable with running NRQL or [PromQL](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/view-query-data/translate-promql-queries-nrql)-type queries, try the query builder's advanced mode.
* If you want to run multiple queries, include `TIMESERIES`.

![NR One transition: data explorer](./images/nrone-transition-data-explorer070120.png "NR One transition: data explorer")

From the New Relic One **data explorer** page, you can navigate all data types, or you can click **query builder** to query, visualize, and share this data.

**<Icon style={{color: 'green'}} name="info"/>

* [Data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types)
* [Query your data via UI or API](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data)
* [Visualize your data with charts and dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards)
* [Terms and conditions](/docs/licenses/product-or-service-licenses/new-relic-one/preview-access-new-relic-one) during your New Relic One preview period

If you feel more comfortable navigating from Insights while making the [transition from Insights to New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/transition-new-relic-one-insights): At the top of any New Relic One page, select **More > Insights**.

## Troubleshoot more efficiently

Everything is interconnected with New Relic One. The relationships between your apps, services, and alerts are all combined in a single, unified user interface. You get a holistic picture of your entire technology ecosystem, especially when problems are detected.

![NR One transition: Alerts and AI 070620](./images/nrone-transition-ai-070620.png "NR One transition: Alerts and AI 070620")

New Relic One's **Alerts & AI** link gives you a single starting point to identify, troubleshoot, and prevent problems across your ecosystem before they impact your customers.

For example:

* New Relic Diagnostics automatically detects common problems with New Relic agents and suggests troubleshooting steps. It can also attach troubleshooting data to your support ticket automatically.
* Alerts will notify you when things that matter to you are going wrong, while Applied Intelligence and muting rules help you screen out items you don't want to see.
* Workloads give you the tools to group and monitor entities in ways that make sense to you. This helps you to understand your complex systems, detect issues, and understand how and why something goes wrong, so you can resolve problems quickly.

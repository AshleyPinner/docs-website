A tag is a key-value pair that can be added to an entity. Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus your data to troubleshoot and understand your environment. For example, you can use tags to:

* Organize all your [entities](/docs/what-are-new-relic-entities) efficiently.
* Identify teams, roles, or regions so you quickly know who is responsible for what.
* Easily find [dashboards](/docs/get-started) that visualize the entities or data you care about.

  Labels for APM and synthetic monitors were replaced by tags. [Learn more](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/end-of-life-notice-synthetics-labels-and-synthetics-apm-group-by-tag/103781).
</Callout>

## Add, edit, and manage tags

You can create and manage tags with [New Relic NerdGraph](/docs/apis/graphql-api/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). Then you can use the tags to filter, facet, and organize the elements of your complex systems in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one-overview).

If you're already familiar with the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql), see the following tutorials for sample queries:

* [Manage tags](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/graphql-tagging-api-tutorial): add, delete, view, and replace tags for entities
* [Query entities](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/use-new-relic-graphql-api-query-entities): search for and see relationships between entities

## View tags and metadata for an entity

After you create tags, it's important to know which tags have been added to various entity types. You can see all the tags that have been added to an entity in two ways:

* **UI**: From the [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-one-entity-explorer), select an entity from the index. On the **Summary** page you can see all the tags that have been added to the entity, as well as the entity's guid, account ID, and App ID.
* **API**: Use NerdGraph to [read the existing tags for an entity](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/graphql-tagging-api-tutorial#read-tags).

After you select an entity from the entity explorer, New Relic automatically shows corresponding metadata about it. Depending on the type of entity (services, hosts, browser or mobile apps, etc.), you can tag, view, facet, search, or query the metadata in several ways, such as:

* [Chart builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder)
* [NerdGraph](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api)
* [NRQL](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions)
* [REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2)

          <td>
            The New Relic [account ID](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) associated with an entity defines what permissions someone has to view or manage data.

            For example, if you know the `Account ID`, you can:

            * Add colleagues to an account so they can see entities
            * Navigate to more specific troubleshooting experiences for an account
          </td>

          <td>
            The New Relic [account name](/docs/accounts/accounts/account-maintenance/change-your-new-relic-account-name) associated with this entity. This can help provide context for which business unit manages the account.

            For example, you can use the `Account name` in the global search or entity index to see a list of entities on a specific account.

## Tagging examples

You can use tags to organize entities across your organization in the following ways:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Use case
      </th>

      <th>
        Tags to use
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Form entities into logical groups
      </td>

      <td>
        Group your entities by applications, names, roles, or regions. Using different tags for various groups allows for more specific filtering in the UI.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Indicate ownership of the entity
      </td>

      <td>
        Use tags for teams, account names, or priority levels to know what needs to be fixed by which team.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Rank entities by criticality
      </td>

      <td>
        Create tags for criticality levels, then add them to your entities so you can easily keep track of your most important ones.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Indicate the environment the entity is deployed to
      </td>

      <td>
        Use tags to keep track of all your AWS integrations or containers.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Indicate facts about the entity
      </td>

      <td>
        Use tags to indicate operating system, agent type, technology platform, or what application an entity is running.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Formatting and parameters

When using tags, be aware of the following parameters:

* An entity can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. This is valid whether you have 100 values for one key, or 100 separate keys that each have a single value.
* A key can have a maximum of 128 characters.
* A value can have a maximum of 256 characters.

<Callout variant="important">
  If using a key in NerdGraph that contains a dash '-' like `key-name`, it needs to be escaped with back ticks `` `key-name` `` because NerdGraph interprets the '-' as a minus.
</Callout>

## Use tags in New Relic One

![New Relic One tags in UI](./images/new-relic-one-tags.png "NR1_EExplorer_tags.png")

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Entity explorer:** After you apply tags to entities, you can easily search for them in the UI.

After you apply tags using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can use them for searching and filtering in the UI. Select tags to filter entities across accounts to focus on just the data and system statuses you care about.

To use tags, search for your tagged terms anywhere you see the `Filter` field. Filtering with tags will surface all entities that have the tag attached, across the accounts you have access to.

Use consistent naming for tags across your organization. Consistent tags make it easier for everyone in your account to filter across complex systems.

## Use labels from APM and synthetic monitors

<Callout variant="important">
  In the APM agent configuration file settings, the `labels` field is used to add tags to your application data.
</Callout>

If you have pre-existing labels for APM or synthetic monitors, you can use them in the same ways you use tags when searching and filtering. To search for your pre-existing labels as tags:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) and click **Entity explorer**.
2. In the `Filter with tags` field, enter your APM or Synthetics label.

## Filter by infrastructure attributes

If you use [attributes with infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent), our infrastructure-monitoring agent registers some attributes as tags. These tags are available by default for searching and filtering in the UI.

Examples of default tags created for a host include:

* `hostname:production-app1.my-corp.net`
* `operatingsystem:linux`
* `agentversion:1.1.7`

Tags drawn directly from infrastructure attributes cannot be edited with NerdGraph. However, you can add additional tags for your infrastructure entities, and edit or remove them with NerdGraph. For example, if you want to associate a given host with a team, you could apply `team:my-team` as a tag, then later edit or remove it as needed.

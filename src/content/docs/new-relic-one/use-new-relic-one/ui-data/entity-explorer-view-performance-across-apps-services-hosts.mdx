Use the entity explorer to access the performance data from all your monitored applications, services, and hosts.

For more about entities, see [What is an entity?](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic)

## View entities

To use the entity explorer: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com)** and select **Entity explorer**.

Your monitored entities are on the left. You may need to scroll your list of entities to see them all.

**[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > Entity explorer**: Use the entity explorer to locate and examine the entities you monitor.

The entity explorer brings together data reported from across all of New Relic. Entity categories include:

* **Services**: [APM](/docs/apm)-monitored applications and services monitored.
* **Hosts**: your monitored [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) (your servers and hosts).
* **Mobile applications**: your [mobile apps](/docs/mobile-monitoring).
* **Browser applications**: your front-end [browser apps](/docs/browser).
* **Integration-reported data**: data from services monitored by [our integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations), including our [on-host integrations](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) (like Kubernetes, StatsD, and NGINX), and cloud platform integrations, like Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Health (alert) status

The entity explorer shows a color-coded [alert](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts) status for entities. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating a critical violation in progress.

![New Relic One entity alert status](./images/new-relic-one-entity-alert-status-red.png "new-relic-one-entity-alert-status.png")

* To see what an alert status means, mouse over it.
* To see details about an entity's alerting status, select the entity.

[NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions-nrql-queries) aren't used to determine alert status because they aren't associated with specific entities.

<Callout variant="important">
  Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM [data retention guidelines](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/overview-data-retention-components#apm), applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI; however, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. For more information, see New Relic's [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/new-relic-feature-end-of-life-announcements/105772).

## Filter by tag or entity name

There are a couple ways to filter down to specific types of entities:

* Filter entities by tags: Use **Filter with tags** at the top of the page. For example, you may want to filter down to only entities tagged with `production`, or only entities with a specific AWS region tag. For more about tags, see [Tagging](/docs/using-tags).
* Filter by entity name: Use **Search services by name** at the top of the page.

## Entity data retention

Availability of data depends on these factors:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Scope
      </th>

      <th>
        Data retention
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Entity explorer and search
      </td>

      <td>
        In the UI, data is available for eight days after an entity no longer exists, with one exception: data reported by integrations, such as Amazon AWS, is only available for one day after an entity ceases to exist.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Our database (accessible via [NRQL query](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/introduction-nrql))
      </td>

      <td>
        For querying our database (for example, via the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder) or data explorer), availability is dependent on the [data retention](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-retention-stored-data) for that data type.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

As a result of these factors, a short-lived entity (like a cloud host) may not be available in the entity explorer list or via search, but its data may still be available via NRQL query.

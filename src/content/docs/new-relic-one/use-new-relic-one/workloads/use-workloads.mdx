To view [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster), go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and click on **Apps** on the right corner. In Apps, select the **Workloads** launcher, and then choose a specific workload.

A Workload looks like this:

Important components in the New Relic One workload UI.

The screenshot numbers are important parts of the workload UI we'd like to describe to you:

1. The **Overview** tab shows the most relevant entity performance and alert data that you need to operate the workload.
   1. **View of workload components.** This is useful for understanding the workload’s architecture, especially if the workload’s entities change over time because they are [dynamically defined](#dynamic).
   2. **Important charts.** These are charts with key metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts).
   3. [**Workload status**](/docs/workloads/use-workloads/workloads/workload-status). You can configure the status to inform about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload.
   4. **Open violations.** You can filter the workload to only the alerting entities to make it easier to troubleshoot the most important issues.
   5. **Linked dashboards.** You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and [create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards](#add-dashboards).

2. The **Entities** tab shows the entities that make up the workload. If you’ve [used queries to dynamically select entities](#dynamic), the entity list will change over time.

3. **Edit workload.** Edit the workload to define the entities that are part of the workload and to link dashboards to the workload.

4. **Summary page**. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's guid, account ID, and App ID.

## Create a workload

A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals.

![New Relic One - workload creation UI](./images/new-relic-create-workload.png "new-relic-create-workload.png")

**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Apps > Workloads > Create a workload:** When you [create a workload](#create), you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities.

You can use New Relic One or [the NerdGraph API](/docs/nerdgraph-workloads-tutorials) to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and click the **Workloads** launcher, and then click **+ Create a workload**.
2. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later.
3. From the **Select an account** dropdown, select the [workload account](#accounts) you'd like to use.
4. Click [Choose the scope accounts](#scope-accounts) to check all of the accounts related to this workload.
5. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload.

   * You can search by entity type, [tags](#tags), or [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) (like app name, account ID, and AWS region).
   * Click **+ Add this query** to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes.
   * Click **+ Add** next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes.
6. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the [query logic](#query-logic).
7. Click **Create a workload** to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time

If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can [set filters on those dashboard links](#filter-dashboards).

Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="tags"
    title="Use tags to define the workload content"
  >
    You can query and select workload entities using both [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute). Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the [tagging documentation](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="query-logic"
    title="How the dynamic query logic works"
  >
    You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload.

    * Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator.
    * Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator.
    * You can wrap strings between percent signs (`%`) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, `<team>-<env>-<appName>`), consider using [tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, `team:awesome`, `env:production`).
    * We recommend not to use percent signs (`%`) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface.

  <Collapser
    id="add-dashboards"
    title="Add dashboards to workloads"
  >
    If you have [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied.

    ![New Relic One workloads - add dashboards](./images/new-relic-workloads-add-dashboards.png "new-relic-workloads-add-dashboards.png")

    **one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads**: You can add dashboards to a workload.

    To add dashboards to a workload:

    1. When creating or editing a workload, type `Dashboard` in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities.
    2. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards.
    3. Click **Add**.

    ![workloads_save_filter.png](./images/workloads_save_filter.png "workloads_save_filter.png")

    **one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads**: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload.

    To filter a workload’s dashboard:

    1. From a workload’s **Overview** page, select a dashboard.
    2. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.
    3. Select **Save filter for this workload**.

## Use the API

You can [query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API](/docs/nerdgraph-workloads-tutorials).
